##

Overview

The Keeper Desktop application includes a built-in SSH agent, enhancing the
security and convenience of managing SSH keys and connections. This feature
simplifies secure access to target systems, eliminates the need to store SSH
keys locally, and supports seamless integration with Keeper's robust key
management and rotation capabilities.

This SSH Agent capability is available to all Keeper users.

##

Key Features

  * **Built-in SSH Agent** : Automatically embedded into the Keeper Desktop application for any private keys, eliminating the need for third-party SSH agents.

  * **No Local Key Storage** : SSH keys are securely stored and managed in Keeper, removing the risk of key exposure on local machines.

  * **Seamless Authorization** : Securely authorize SSH access to target systems when the Keeper vault is unlocked.

  * **Local and Remote Use** : Supports SSH connections to line-of-sight targets in addition to managed systems via KeeperPAM [tunnels](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/tunnels).

  * **Git Integration** : Authenticate with Github and Gitlab, and sign your Git commits without having to store private keys locally on the workstation.

  * **Encrypted keys** : SSH private keys held in Keeper can be encrypted with a passphrase, adding an additional layer of protection. Keeper enhances this by allowing the record's password field to act as the passphrase, ensuring seamless security and usability.

  * **Key Rotation** : Keeper's automatic SSH key rotation works seamlessly with the SSH agent to ensure that the latest keys are always available for use.

##

Downloads

The Keeper Desktop application is available from the [Download
Page](https://www.keepersecurity.com/download.html) of our website.

##

Storing Keys in Keeper

In the Keeper vault, you can store the SSH private key two ways:

  * Added as a custom field

  * Attached as a file

In both scenarios, Keeper supports password-protected keys as long as the
password is saved to the record password field.

####

**PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail)**

A base64-encoded format typically used for private keys. It is commonly used
with OpenSSL and older OpenSSH versions. Example:

Copy

    
    
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    (Base64-encoded data)
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

####

**OpenSSH**

The default format for keys generated by the `ssh-keygen` utility in modern
versions of OpenSSH (>=7.8). It uses a custom serialization format for private
keys. Example:

Copy

    
    
    -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
    (Base64-encoded data)
    -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

####

**PKCS#8**

A standardized format for encoding private keys that supports multiple key
types. Often used with OpenSSL or for interoperability. Example:

Copy

    
    
    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
    (Base64-encoded data)
    -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

##

Benefits of SSH Agent

The SSH Agent embedded within the Keeper application allows keys stored
securely in Keeper to be seamlessly used by your computer.

The SSH protocol works by cycling through all loaded keys in the agent until
it finds a match with the server. However, OpenSSH imposes a default limit on
the number of keys the agent can try during a single authentication attempt,
which is typically **6 keys**. This limitation is defined by the
`MaxAuthTries` parameter in SSH configurations and is not something Keeper can
directly control.

To address this, Keeper has implemented enhancements to optimize key usage.
For example, when you activate a Tunnel associated with a specific resource,
Keeper ensures that the key for that Tunnel is immediately activated by the
agent. If the maximum limit of active keys is reached, Keeper prioritizes the
relevant key by moving it to the top of the agent's list, ensuring it is used
for the connection.

##

Activating the SSH Agent

From the Keeper Desktop application, visit the **Settings** > **Developer**
screen and manage the SSH Agent from this screen.

When you enable the SSH Agent, all of the specified SSH keys stored in Keeper
will be available to your local machine while the vault is unlocked.

Select "Launch SSH Agent on startup" to activate the SSH agent upon every
login.

To enable SSH agent on specific keys, select those keys from the provided
drop-down.

##

Configuration of your Terminal

In order to work with the local operating system (macOS and Windows), follow
the [guide below](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/ssh-
agent#configuring-your-terminal-for-keeper-ssh-agent) to enable SSH Agent for
your desired terminal. An environment variable must be set to instruct your
computer to use Keeper's SSH Agent.

  * [SSH Agent Configuration](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/ssh-agent#configuration-of-your-terminal)

##

Using SSH Agent

In its simplest use case, you can store the SSH key in Keeper. When you use an
SSH client on your computer for any operation requiring a private key,
Keeper's SSH Agent—integrated into the Keeper desktop application—will
activate and prompt the user to authorize the request, provided the vault is
unlocked.

##

Using SSH Agent with Git

  * [Integration with Git](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/ssh-agent/integration-with-git)

##

Using SSH Agent with Tunnels

For zero-trust [Tunnel](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/tunnels)
connections through a target resource, Keeper's SSH agent will automatically
authenticate the session.

After a tunnel has been activated on a PAM resource, the SSH Command will
display beneath the tunnel information.

If the Keeper SSH Agent has not yet been activated, clicking on the SSH
Command `(?)` help dialog will display a link to open the SSH Agent
configuration screen.

From the local terminal, paste the SSH command.

On your desktop computer, the Keeper Desktop will launch an authorization
request that contains the key which is being requested. To authorize the
request, click Authorize. To authorize subsequent requests for this key,
select the "Don't ask again" option.

After access has been granted, the SSH connection is instantly established to
the target system, through the encrypted Keeper tunnel.

##

Terminal Configuration

To use the Keeper SSH Agent, copy and paste the command to your shell's
startup file:

For example:

Copy

    
    
    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK='/path/to/keeper-ssh-agent.sock'

###

**macOS (zsh)**

  * Edit the file `~/.zshrc`

  * Apply changes: `source ~/.zshrc`

###

**Linux & Ubuntu (bash)**

  * Edit the file `~/.bashrc`

  * Apply changes: `source ~/.bashrc`

###

**fish Shell**

  * Edit the file `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

  * Add this line and save:

Copy

    
    
    set -x SSH_AUTH_SOCK /path/to/keeper-ssh-agent.sock

  * Apply changes:

Copy

    
    
    source ~/.config/fish/config.fish

###

**Verify the Configuration:**

Copy

    
    
    echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK

You should see: `/path/to/keeper-ssh-agent.sock`

You may need to open a new shell for this to take effect.

##

Rotation of SSH Keys

KeeperPAM provides automatic rotation of SSH keys on-demand or on a scheduled
basis.

  * See the [Password Rotation](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/password-rotation) section and the [Linux User](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/password-rotation/rotation-use-cases/local-network/linux-user) SSH Key use case

The Keeper SSH Agent allows you to seamlessly authenticate into services like
GitHub and securely sign Git commits. To help you get started, we've created a
step-by-step guide on setting up  and  using Keeper.
