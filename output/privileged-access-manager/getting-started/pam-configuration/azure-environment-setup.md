Azure Environment Overview

In order to set up your Azure environment, the following steps must be taken:

  * Create an Azure application in the default Azure Active Directory.

  * Get values for the Keeper PAM Configuration from this new application.

  * Grant permissions to the application to access the Azure Active Directory.

  * Create a custom role to allow the application to access/perform actions on various Azure resources.

###

**Create an Azure App Registration**

Go to the **Azure portal** > **Home** and click on **Microsoft Entra ID** on
the left side vertical menu. Select **App Registrations,** and then **New
Registration**. Give the new application a name and select **Single tenant**.
Then click the **Register** button at the bottom.

In the **Overview** of the application, the **Application (client) ID** UUID
is shown. This is the **Client Id** field of the Keeper PAM Configuration
record. The **Directory (tenant) ID** is also shown. This is the **Tenant Id**
field of the Keeper PAM Configuration record. Save these values for later.

Next, click on the **Add a certification or secret** for **Client
credentials**. On the next page, click on New client secret, give the client
secret a Description, and select a desired Expires date, and click **Add**.

The page will refresh showing the secret **Value**. Copy the **Value** (not
Secret ID) into the Keeper PAM Configuration "Client Secret" field. Save this
value for later.

At this point, all the required the PAM Configuration fields should be filled
in. You also have an Azure application that cannot do anything yet.

###

Assign Roles and Administrators

In order for the Azure tenant service principal/application to rotate Azure
Active Directory users or Azure Active Directory Domain Service users, the
application must be a assigned to an Administrative role.

From the Azure portal go to **Home** > **Azure Active Directory** > **Roles
and administrators** , and click on the Administrative role to use (such as
Privileged Authentication Administrator). The correct role depends on what
privileges are needed for your use case. Custom roles can be used.

  * **Global Administrator** \- It is not recommended to use a Global Administrator on a service principal. However, it will allow both administrator and user passwords to be rotated.

  *   * 

To add the application, click **Add assignments** and **Search** for the
service principal/application that was created, click it, and then **Add**.

##

**Assign Azure Role**

Roles need to be attached to the Azure Application (also called a Service
Principle here) in order to rotate passwords of target resources. This is done
in the Subscription section of the Azure portal.

Go to the **Azure portal** > **Home** > **Subscriptions** then select your
subscription. Click on **Access control (IAM)** , and then **Roles**.

Click **Add** on the top menu, and then **Add custom role**. Jump to the
**JSON** tab. Click on **Edit** and paste the JSON object from below,
modifying it according to your setup.

This is a complete list of all of the permissions that Keeper Gateway can use,
if applicable. Only include those that are needed for your setup.

Change the following before you save:

  * <ROLE NAME>: Role Name, e.g. "Keeper Secrets Manager"

  * <DESCRIPTION>: Description, e.g. "Role for password rotation"

  * <SUBSCRIPTION ID>: Subscription ID of this Azure subscription

Copy

    
    
    {
        "properties": {
            "roleName": "<ROLE NAME>",
            "description": "<DESCRIPTION>",
            "assignableScopes": [
                "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>"
            ],
            "permissions": [
                {
                    "actions": [
                        "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read",
                        "Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/read",
                        "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/read",

                        "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/instanceView/read",
                        "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
                        "Microsoft.AAD/domainServices/read",
                        "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read",
                        "Microsoft.Sql/servers/read",
                        "Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/read",
                        "Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers/read",
                        "Microsoft.DBforMySQL/servers/read",
                        "Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers/databases/read",
                        "Microsoft.Sql/servers/write",
                        "Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers/write",
                        "Microsoft.DBforMySQL/servers/write",
                        "Microsoft.DBforMySQL/flexibleServers/read",
                        "Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers/read",
                        "Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers/write",
                        "Microsoft.DBforMySQL/flexibleServers/write",
                        "Microsoft.DBforMariaDB/servers/read",
                        "Microsoft.DBforMariaDB/servers/write"
                    ],
                    "notActions": [],
                    "dataActions": [],
                    "notDataActions": []
                }
            ]
        }
    }

Click **Save**.

When done, click **Review + create,** and click **Create**.

Once the role is created, it needs to be assigned to the Application (Service
Principle). Click **View** in the **Details** column.

A panel will appear on the right side of the screen. Click **Assignments** ,
and then **Add assignment**.

Enter in the new role's name in the search bar on the **Role** tab, then
double click it to select it. Move to the **Members** tab. Click **Select
members**. In the panel that opens, enter the name of the Azure application,
select the current application, and click **Select**.

Go to the **Review + assign** tab click **Review + assign**.

At this point, you have created the necessary roles and applications within
your Azure environment.
