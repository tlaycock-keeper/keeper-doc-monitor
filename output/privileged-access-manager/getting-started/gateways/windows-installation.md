Overview

This document contains information on how to install, configure, and update
the Keeper Gateway on Windows.

###

Prerequisite

###

Installation

The latest Keeper Gateway for Windows is downloaded from here:

  * 

You can run the service under system privilege or use a service account.

####

New Installs

####

Upgrading

If you are upgrading an existing Gateway, un-check the "Enter a Keeper One-
Time Access Token" so that the existing configuration is maintained.

####

**Installation Location**

The default installation location is the following:

Copy

    
    
    C:\ProgramFiles (x86)\Keeper Gateway\<version>

####

Setup Options

  * Install Windows service - Installs the gateway as a Windows service.

    *     * Start Windows service - Start the Keeper Gateway service immediately after installation

    * Enable automatic updates

  *   * Remove Keeper Gateway configuration and logs from previous installations

####

Specifying the Keeper Gateway Service Account

If "Use service account" is specified you will be prompted to enter the valid
credentials of the desired service account:

####

One-Time Access Token

After clicking "Next", click "Install" in the next screen to install the
Keeper Gateway.

###

Gateway Service Management

After installing and running the Keeper Gateway as a service, this service can
be accessed and easily managed within the Windows Services Manager as "Keeper
Gateway Service".

###

**Configuration File**

If the Keeper Gateway is installed and running as a service, the gateway
configuration file is stored in the following location:

Copy

    
    
    C:\ProgramData\KeeperGateway\config\gateway-config.json

If the Keeper Gateway is installed locally and not running as a service, the
gateway configuration file is stored in the following location:

Copy

    
    
    C:\Users\<User>\.keeper\gateway-config.json

###

**Log files**

Logs that contain helpful debugging information are automatically created and
stored on the local machine.

If the gateway is running as a service, the gateway log files are stored in
the following location:

Copy

    
    
    C:\ProgramData\KeeperGateway\logs\

If the gateway is not running as a service, the gateway log files are stored
in the following location:

Copy

    
    
    C:\Users\<User>\.keeper\logs\

####

**Verbose Logging**

To activate verbose logging:

  * Go to Windows Services > Keeper Gateway > Properties

  * Stop the service

  * Set the "Start parameters" to: `--debug` or `-d`

  * Start the service by clicking on "Start" _Do not click "OK" without first starting the service as it will not persist the Parameter setting_

###

**Upgrading**

To upgrade, stop the service, install the latest version and then start the
service.

  * Back up your `gateway-config.json` configuration file

  * Run the latest Keeper Gateway installer

  * During installation **DO NOT** select "Enter a Keeper One-Time Access Token".

###

**Auto Updates**

Select "Enable automatic updates" during the installer process to ensure that
your Keeper Gateway is automatically updated when there are new versions
available.

* * *

###

Silent Install

This section provides instructions for performing a silent installation of the
Keeper Gateway on Windows systems. Silent installation allows the setup
process to run in the background without displaying any user interface or
messages.

To install the Keeper Gateway silently, use the following command in your
command prompt or script:

Copy

    
    
    keeper-gateway_windows_x86_64.exe /verysilent /suppressmsgboxes /norestart /token=<TOKEN>

Replace `<TOKEN>` with the token provided in the Keeper Vault when creating
the Keeper Gateway.

####

Configuration Options

If you have previously installed Keeper Gateway and wish to use the existing
configuration, you can bypass the token entry by using:

Copy

    
    
    /existingconfig=1

To generate a log file during the installation process, use the following
option and specify the desired log file path:

Copy

    
    
    /log=<Optional log file>

####

**Windows Service Account**

If you prefer to run the Keeper Gateway under a specific Windows service
account, use the following options to specify the account details:

Copy

    
    
    /mergetasks="service/account" /serviceuser=<ACCOUNT USERNAME> /servicepass=<ACCOUNT PASSWORD>

Replace `<ACCOUNT USERNAME>` and `<ACCOUNT PASSWORD>` with the credentials of
the service account you intend to use.

####

**Auto Updater**

To enable the Auto Updater feature, allowing Keeper Gateway to automatically
check for and apply updates, use the following option:

Copy

    
    
    /autoupdate=1

###

Uninstalling

To uninstall the service:

  * Uninstall Keeper Gateway from "Add and remove programs"

  * If desired, delete the private configuration .json file

Prior to proceeding with this document, make sure you .

Upon installation of the service, select "Enter a Keeper One-Time Access
Token" and supply the token provided by when you  on the Vault. After
installation, the service will automatically start up and register with the
Keeper cloud.

Use service account - Use the , otherwise the account installing the gateway
will be used.

Turn on debug logging - Enable  on the gateway log files. NOT recommended for
production environments. Only use this when debugging with Keeper support.

The final step prior to successfully installing the Keeper Gateway as service
is to enter the  Token provided from the Keeper Vault.

The Keeper Gateway configuration file contains a set of tokens that includes
encryption keys, client identifiers, and tenant server information used to
authenticate and decrypt data from the Keeper Secrets Manager APIs. This
configuration file is created from the One-Time Access Token generated when
you .

The Keeper Gateway establishes outbound-only connections and does not require
any inbound firewall rules. The following outbound connections must be
allowed:

Destination

Port Needed

More Info

Keeper Cloud _(keepersecurity.[com|eu|com.au|jp|ca|us])_

TLS Port 443

Communicates with Keeper Cloud to access target infrastructure via native
protocols (e.g., SSH, RDP)

Keeper KRelay Server _(krelay.keepersecurity.[com|eu|com.au|jp|ca|us])_

TCP and UDP opened on Port 3478 Outbound access to TCP and UDP ports 49152
through 65535

Facilitates secure and encrypted relay connections between end-user's vault
and target systems via the Gateway

The Gateway preserves zero knowledge by performing all encryption and
decryption of data locally. Keeper Secrets Manager APIs are used to
communicate with the Keeper cloud.
