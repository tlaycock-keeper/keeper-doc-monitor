# Auto Updater

Instructions for installing and configuring the Auto Updater for the Keeper
Gateway.

##

Overview

Automatic updates of the Keeper Gateway can be enabled on Linux and Windows
installations through Keeper's Auto Updater feature. The Auto Updater makes
periodic checks to update your Keeper Gateway to the latest version.

By default, the Auto Updater is disabled when installing the Keeper Gateway

We recommend enabling the Auto Updater to ensure you receive the most recent
security and functionality enhancements. The Auto Updater verifies all Keeper
Gateway downloads by checking the GPG signature of hash value, which are then
utilized to checksum each file.

##

**Auto Updater Installation**

###

**Prerequisites**

  * Ensure that you have administrative privileges on the system.

  * Version 1.4.0 or later of Keeper Gateway is required.

###

**Docker**

On Docker based installations, the best way to update the container is running
the below commands from a cron job or your CI/CD tools.

As an example, create a file called `update_gateway.sh` that contains:

Copy

    
    
    #!/bin/bash
    set -e  # Exit immediately if a command fails
    
    # Navigate to the directory containing your docker-compose.yml file
    cd /path/to/your/docker-compose-directory
    
    # Pull the latest image and update the Gateway container
    docker compose pull
    docker compose up -d keeper-gateway

Make the script executable:

Copy

    
    
    chmod +x update_gateway.sh

Edit the crontab:

Copy

    
    
    crontab -e

Add a line to schedule the script. For example, to run it every day at 3 AM:

Copy

    
    
    0 3 * * * /path/to/update_gateway.sh >> /var/log/update_gateway.log 2>&1

###

**Linux**

####

**New Gateway**

Execute the following command to download and run the KeeperPAM installer with
auto update enabled.

The `--autoupdate` parameter activates the auto updater in addition to the
Keeper Gateway.

Copy

    
    
    curl -fsSL https://keepersecurity.com/pam/install | \
      sudo bash -s -- --autoupdate

####

**Existing Keeper Gateway**

Activate the Auto Updater on an existing installation by executing the
following Keeper Gateway command:

Copy

    
    
    sudo keeper-gateway autoupdate enable

**Verify Installation (Optional)**

Verify that the Auto Updater has been installed successfully by executing the
following Keeper Gateway command:

Copy

    
    
    sudo keeper-gateway autoupdate status

###

Windows

####

New Gateway

  * Download and run the latest version of the Gateway installer.

  * During installation, check the box "Enable automatic updates".

  * This setup option will create a new Task Scheduler task for updating the Gateway.

**Existing Gateway**

  * Open a command prompt as Administrator.

  * Install Auto Updater with the following Keeper Gateway command:

Copy

    
    
    keeper-gateway autoupdate enable

**Verify Installation (Optional)**

  * Open a command prompt as Administrator.

  * Verify that Auto Updater has been installed successfully by executing the following Keeper Gateway command:

Copy

    
    
    keeper-gateway autoupdate status

##

Auto Updater Status

###

Prerequisites

  * Ensure that you have administrative privileges on the system.

  * Version 1.4.0 or later of Keeper Gateway is required.

###

Status on Linux

Check the Auto Updater status by executing the following Keeper Gateway
command:

Copy

    
    
    sudo keeper-gateway autoupdate status

###

Status on Windows

  * Open a command prompt as Administrator

  * Check the Auto Updater status by executing the following Keeper Gateway command:

Copy

    
    
    keeper-gateway autoupdate status

##

Auto Updater Configuration

###

Configuration on Linux

Edit the crontab that runs Auto Updater.

Copy

    
    
    sudo crontab -e

Here is an example of the default crontab entry that checks for updates every
hour:

Copy

    
    
    0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/keeper-gateway-update --trust

  * The first part `0 * * * *` is the crontab expression which will cause execution to occur every hour at 0 minutes.

  * The second part is the update command `keeper-gateway-update`

  * The option `--trust` causes explicit trust of the Keeper Gateway GPG public key for verification of downloaded install files.

###

Configuration on Windows

Configure the update frequency and other settings with the following steps:

  * Run `taskschd.msc` to open Windows Task Scheduler.

  * In the left pane double-click on Task Scheduler Library -> Keeper -> Gateway -> AutoUpdate to show the Auto Updater Task.

  * In the upper middle pane double-click on the AutoUpdate Task with the name of the current version and click on the Triggers menu tab.

  * Click `Edit...` to change when the Auto Updater checks for a new update to install. The default is to "Repeat task every 1 hour indefinitely" as shown below.

##

Auto Updater Removal

###

Prerequisites

  * Ensure that you have administrative privileges on the system.

  * Version 1.4.0 or later of Keeper Gateway is required.

###

Removal on Linux

Remove Auto Updater by executing the following Keeper Gateway command:

Copy

    
    
    sudo keeper-gateway autoupdate disable

###

Removal on Windows

Remove Auto Updater with the following steps:

  * Open a command prompt as Administrator.

  * Remove Auto Updater with the following Keeper Gateway command:

Copy

    
    
    keeper-gateway autoupdate disable

##

Troubleshooting

###

Check the status of the Auto Update

Copy

    
    
    keeper-gateway autoupdate status

###

Logging in the Gateway Auto Updater

To assist with diagnosing issues or monitoring the status of updates, the
Gateway Auto Updater generates two types of logs. These logs are subject to
rotation policies to avoid overuse of disk space.

###

Linux

**Log Location**

All log files for Linux are located in `/var/log/keeper-gateway`

**Log Files**

  * **Update Logs** : Any logs generated during an update will be timestamped and stored as `update_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log`.

  * **Last Update Check** : The file `last-update-check.log` contains information regarding the most recent check for updates.

###

Windows

####

**Log Location**

The log files for the Gateway Auto Updater are located in
`\ProgramData\KeeperGateway\install`

**Log Files**

  * **Update Logs** : Any logs generated during an update will be timestamped and stored as `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log`

  * **Last Update Check** : The file `last-update-check.log` contains information regarding the most recent check for updates.
