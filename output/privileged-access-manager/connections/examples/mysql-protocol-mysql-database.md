Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to configure a MySQL Database on your **PAM
Database** and configure the **MySQL protocol** to successfully launch a zero-
trust connection to the MySQL Database — directly from your Keeper Vault.

###

Summary

For this setup, you need to do the following:

  1.   2.   3.   4.   5. 

After completing the above, you can launch zero-trust connections to the MySQL
Database directly from your Keeper Vault.

##

Step 1 - Enable Connection Enforcement Policies

From the Admin Console, enable the corresponding [PAM Enforcement
Policies](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/enforcement-
policies) for connections:

Policy

Definition

Commander CLI

Can configure connection and session recording

Allow users to configure Connection and Session Recordings settings on PAM
Machine, PAM Directory, PAM Database and PAM Configuration Record Types

Copy

    
    
    ALLOW_CONFIGURE_PAM_CLOUD_CONNECTION_SETTINGS

Can launch connections

Allow users to launch connections on PAM Machine, PAM Directory, PAM Database
Record Types

Copy

    
    
    ALLOW_LAUNCH_PAM_ON_CLOUD_CONNECTION

Can view session recordings

Allow users to view Session Recordings

Copy

    
    
    ALLOW_VIEW_KCM_RECORDINGS

##

Step 2 - Install and configure the Keeper Gateway

Prior to creating the PAM Record types in your Vault, the Keeper Gateway needs
to be installed in your infrastructure. Visit the following guides based on
your needs:

  * [Windows Installation](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/gateways/windows-installation)

  * [Linux Installation](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/gateways/linux-installation)

  * [Docker Installation](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/gateways/docker-installation)

Additionally, the Keeper Gateways needs to be configured with the Gateway
token. For more information, visit this [page](/en/keeperpam/privileged-
access-manager/getting-started/gateways/one-time-access-token).

Steps 3 and Step 4 can be automated with the Gateway Wizard. For more
information, visit this [page](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/quick-
start-sandbox).

##

Step 3 - Configuring the PAM Configuration

The [PAM Configuration ](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-
started/pam-configuration)contains critical information on your
infrastructure, settings and associated Keeper Gateway. Visit the following
pages for more details based on your target infrastructure:

  * [Setting up Local Environment on the PAM Configuration](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/pam-configuration/local-environment-setup)

  * [Setting up AWS Environment on the PAM Configuration](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/pam-configuration/aws-environment-setup)

  * [Setting up Azure Environment on the PAM Configuration](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/pam-configuration/azure-environment-setup)

##

Step 4 - Create and Configure PAM Database and PAM User(s) Records

After setting up your Gateway and PAM Configuration Record, the MySQL Database
and its users need to be configured on PAM Record types in your Vault:

  * [PAM Database](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/pam-resources/pam-database) \- The MySQL Database is configured on this record type

  * [PAM User](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/pam-resources/pam-user) \- The MySQL Database User is configured on this record type

Refer to this example on how to configure MySQL Database on a PAM Database
record type:

[Example: MySQL Database](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-
started/pam-resources/pam-database/example-mysql-database)

##

Step 5 - Configuring PAM Settings and MySQL Protocol

The PAM Database record type contains the necessary information required for
the Keeper Gateway to locate and establish a connection with the database,
while the PAM User record type contains the necessary information to
authenticate the connection.

The PAM Settings need to be configured to enable connections or tunnels on the
target defined on the PAM Database Record. To configure the MySQL protocol,
visit the following page:

[MySQL Connections](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-
manager/connections/session-protocols/mysql-connections)

##

Launching Connections

Once you have configured the MySQL Protocol connection on your PAM Database
Record, your record will contain the following connection banner with the
"Launch" Button:

![](https://docs.keeper.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F762006384-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-
x-
prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-MJXOXEifAmpyvNVL1to%252Fuploads%252FLT7kp5Yt2zTfQZRIWezl%252Fsqlconn.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dbe6b3a97-684b-4288-9ede-8f1bdb0766e3&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=53446bd6&sv=2)

In the above image, a MySQL Database has been configured on the PAM Database
Record. When clicking launch, the Vault Client will render a window with the
established connection protocol to the specified target.

##

Sharing PAM Database Records

PAM Database records can be shared with other Keeper users within your
organization. However, the recipient must have the appropriate PAM enforcement
policies in place to utilize KeeperPAM features on the shared PAM records.

When sharing a PAM Database record, the linked admin credentials will **not**
be shared. For example, if the PAM Database is configured with a MySQL
Database, the recipient can connect to the MySQL Database on the PAM Database
record without having direct access to the linked credentials.
