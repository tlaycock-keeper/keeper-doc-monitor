Quick Start Wizard

To learn some KeeperPAM basics, we have created a wizard that is integrated
into the Vault. If you select the Docker install method, this wizard will
create all the necessary vault records, configurations and a customized Docker
Compose file for quickly standing up a sandbox environment in less than 3
minutes.

1

###

Activate KeeperPAM

  * Login to the Admin Console in your region:

  * Under **Admin** > **Roles** , create a new role for PAM or modify an existing role

  * Go to **Enforcement Policies** and open the "**Privilege Access Manager** " section.

  * Enable all the PAM enforcement policies

  * Ensure you are assigned to this role

2

###

Run the New Gateway Wizard

  *   * Click on **Create New** > **Gateway**

  * Enter a name for the project, such as "**My Infrastructure Demo** "

  * Select **Docker** for the gateway

  * Select "**Create with example records** "

  * Click **Next**

  * After the wizard is finished, immediately download the provided `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-seccomp.json` files.

3

###

Run the Docker Environment

  * Set up a VM which supports Docker. It can be a Linux instance or Windows running Docker Desktop. The instance can exist anywhere, even on your local computer.

  *   * Transfer the Docker Compose and Seccomp files from Step 2 to the VM.

  * Run `docker compose up -d` from the folder where the files are saved.

    * You may need to use a dash, e.g. `docker-compose up -d` depending on the VM

4

###

Test some PAM features

  * You can now instantly connect to any of the resources by clicking "Launch" from the record detail view.

  * The MySQL account, SSH password and SSH key can be rotated by clicking "Rotate" from the record detail within the Users folder.

  * Note: Remote Browser Isolation won't work on some ARM processors

###

Records Created

The wizard will create the following in your vault:

  * A folder containing Resources and Users in separate shared folders

  * A MySQL database

  * A Linux machine with VNC connection to the desktop UI

  * A Linux machine with SSH connection using an SSH Key

  * A Linux machine with SSH connection using a password

  * A Linux machine with RDP connection to the desktop UI

  * A Remote Browser Isolation session to bing.com

  * A Secrets Manager Application and PAM Configuration with all PAM features enabled

  * A Keeper Gateway ready to initialize

###

Quick Start Video

We've created a helpful Keeper 101 video to set up your sandbox environment:
