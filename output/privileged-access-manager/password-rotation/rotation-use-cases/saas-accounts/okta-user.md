Overview

This documentation explains how to rotate Okta accounts using KeeperPAM's
rotation option called "Run PAM scripts only". This is a setting in the PAM
User rotation settings which tells the Gateway to skip the primary rotation
method and directly execute the post-rotation script attached to the PAM User
record in the vault.

##

Prerequisites

  * **KSM Application:** Ensure that the Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) application is set up.

  * **Shared Folder:** A shared folder should be set up where all the records will be stored.

  * **PAM Configuration:** Ensure that the PAM Configuration is set up and that the Gateway is running and attached to this configuration.

  * **Okta API Token:** You will need an Okta API Token to interact with the Okta API.

###

Obtain Okta API Token

  1. Follow the steps in the official [Okta documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/main/) to generate an API token.

  2. Store this API token in a Keeper record. The record can be of any type, but for this example, we will use a "Login" type.

     * Store the API Token in the "password" field.

     * Store the Organization URL in the "Website Address" field.

  3. Name this record "Okta API Access Details" as this title will be used to fetch the record in the script later.

###

Step 2: Set Up Rotation Record

Create a new PAM User record to store Okta User details whose password will be
rotated.

  * Set the username to match the Okta user's email address.

  * Set the password to the current password set for the user.

Okta SDK only supports password rotation if the current password is valid. If
the password is incorrect, the rotation will fail.

###

Step 3: Add PAM Script

  *   * Add the "Additional Credential" record, which is the "Okta API Access Details" record created in Step 1.

In the example below, we'll use the bash script because the Keeper Gateway is
running as a Docker container.

###

Step 4: Configure Password Rotation Settings

  * **Rotation Type:** Set it to "Run PAM scripts only"

  * **PAM Configuration** : Select the configuration for your environment

###

Environment Setup

In order for the post-rotation script to execute, the host where the Keeper
Gateway is running needs to have the necessary execution environment
available.

###

Bash Script

The Bash script below works on the latest Docker version of the Keeper Gateway
or any Linux environment that has `jq` installed.

Copy

    
    
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    
    # CAUTION: Okta only allows password reset where the previous password is supplied.
    # If the operation fails, this script will NOT roll back to the old password.
    # Please ensure that the old password is correct before running this script.
    # This script is provided as an example only and is not supported by Keeper Security.
    
    # This will be executed as the following
    # history -c && echo "BASE64STRING==" | /path/to/script.sh
    
    # Without this the script might report a success
    # if something fails in the script.
    set -o pipefail -e
    
    IFS= read -r params
    json=$(echo "$params" | base64 -d)
    
    # There is no built in JSON parser.
    # In order to parse JSON, a tool like jq or fx is required.
    $(echo "$json" | jq -r 'keys[] as $k | "export \($k)=\(.[$k])"')
    
    # Set your Okta API token and organization URL
    recordJson=$(echo "$records" | base64 -d)
    OKTA_API_RECORD="Okta API Access Details"
    OKTA_API_TOKEN=$(echo "$recordJson" | jq -r ".[] | select(.title == \"$OKTA_API_RECORD\").password")
    OKTA_ORG_URL=$(echo "$recordJson" | jq -r ".[] | select(.title == \"$OKTA_API_RECORD\").url")
    
    # Set the user's ID and the new password
    USER_ID="$user"
    OLD_PASSWORD="$oldPassword"
    NEW_PASSWORD="$newPassword"
    
    curl -v -X POST \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: SSWS "$OKTA_API_TOKEN"" \
    -d '{
        "oldPassword": "'"$OLD_PASSWORD"'",
        "newPassword": "'"$NEW_PASSWORD"'"
    }' "$OKTA_ORG_URL/api/v1/users/$USER_ID/credentials/change_password"

###

Python Script

The Python script below is well-commented and follows best practices. It
imports necessary modules, initializes variables, and defines functions for
various tasks like finding a password by its title, fetching all Okta users,
and rotating the password for the particular user.

Copy

    
    
    #!/usr/local/bin/python3
    
    import asyncio
    import sys
    import base64
    import json

    # If the operation fails, this script will NOT roll back to the old password.
    # Please ensure that the old password is correct before running this script.
    
    # Display Python version
    print(f"# Python version: {sys.version}")
    
    # Display installed packages. Uncomment lines below to inspect the environment to make sure that the
    # required packages are installed.
