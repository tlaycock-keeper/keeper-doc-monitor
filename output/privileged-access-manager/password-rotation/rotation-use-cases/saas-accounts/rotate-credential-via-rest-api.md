Overview

This documentation provides generic instructions on how to set up password
rotation using KeeperPAM's rotation option called "Run PAM scripts only". This
is a setting in the PAM User rotation settings which tells the Gateway to skip
the primary rotation method and directly execute the post-rotation script
attached to the PAM User record in the vault.

This guide includes pre-requisites, step-by-step instructions, and a Python
script example.

###

Pre-requisites

  1. **KSM Application:** Ensure that the Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) application is set up.

  2. **Shared Folder:** A shared folder should be set up where all the records will be stored.

  3. **PAM Configuration:** Ensure that the PAM Configuration is set up and that the Gateway is running and attached to this configuration.

  4. **REST API Token:** You will need an API Token to interact with the arbitrary API.

###

Step 1: Obtain REST API Token or Access Token

  1. Follow the steps in your target application or service to generate an API token.

  2. Store this API token in a Keeper record. The record can be of any type, but for this example, we will use a "Login" type.

     * Store the API Token in the "password" field.

     * Store the Organization URL in the "Website Address" field.

  3. Name this record "API Access Details" as this title will be used to fetch the record in the script later.

###

Step 2: Set Up Rotation Record

Create a new PAM User record to store target User details whose password will
be rotated.

  * Set the username to match the user's login ID.

  * Set the password to the current password set for the user (this really depends on the REST endpoint)

###

Step 3: Add PAM Script

  1. Attach the below [Python script](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/password-rotation/rotation-use-cases/saas-accounts/rotate-credential-via-rest-api#python-script) that will perform the password rotation. The script has additional comments inside that describe each line.

  2. Add the "Rotation Credential" record, which is the record created in Step 1 containing the API Token and URL.

  3. Enable No-Operation (NOOP) atomic execution:

     * In the current PAM User record where user's details are stored, create a new custom text field labeled `NOOP` and set its value to `True`.

###

Step 4: Configure Password Rotation Settings

  1. **Rotation Type:** Set it to "On-Demand" for this example.

  2. **Password Complexity:** Leave it as default unless you have specific requirements.

  3. **Rotation Settings:** Point to the PAM Configuration set up earlier.

  4. **Administrative Credentials Record:** Can should be left empty

###

Step 5: Python Environment Setup

Below steps are related to the environment where the Keeper Gateway is
running.

  1. Ensure that the Python environment has all necessary dependencies installed.

  2. If you want to use a virtual environment, add a shebang line at the top of the script.

     * Note: Ensure that the shebang line does not contain spaces. If it does, create a symbolic link without spaces. Example to create a symbolic link on Linux: `sudo ln -s "/Users/john/PAM Rotation Example/.venv/bin/python3" /usr/local/bin/pam_rotation_venv_python3`

###

Python Script

The Python script is well-commented and follows best practices. It imports
necessary modules, initializes variables, and defines a rotation function to
call an arbitrary REST API that changes user's password.

Copy

    
    
    #!/usr/local/bin/pam_rotation_venv_python3
    
    # NOTE: If spaces are present in the path to the python interpreter, the script will fail to execute.
    #       This is a knows limitation of the shebang line in Linux and you will need to create a symlink
    #       to the python interpreter in a path that does not contain spaces.
    #       For example: sudo ln -s "/usr/local/bin/my python3.7" /usr/local/bin/pam_rotation_venv_python3
    
    # NOTE: This script is a demonstration of how to use the REST API to rotate passwords. It does not
    #       actually call a real API. You will need to modify the script to call your own API.
