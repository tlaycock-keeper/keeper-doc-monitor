Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to set up password rotation to rotate Cisco
Meraki network credentials.

##

Prerequisites

  * **KSM Application:** Ensure that the Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) application is set up.

  * **Shared Folder:** A shared folder should be set up where all the records will be stored.

  * **PAM Configuration:** Ensure that the PAM Configuration is set up and that the Gateway is running and attached to this configuration.

  * **Requests Library:** Ensure that the requests library is installed in your Python environment. This library is necessary for making HTTP requests to Cisco devices.

  * **Setting up AnyConnect Cisco VPN:** In order to connect to cisco devices, ensure that the machine hosting Keeper Gateway has Cisco AnyConnect VPN installed and properly configured

  * **Test Cisco Device Connectivity**

###

Requests library installation

The Requests library allows you to send HTTP requests easily. Activate a
Python virtual environment in your Keeper Gateway environment and install the
library using the following command:

Copy

    
    
    pip install requests

###

**Setting up AnyConnect Cisco VPN**

Ensure that the machine hosting Keeper Gateway has Cisco AnyConnect VPN
installed and properly configured inorder to connect to cisco device. This
setup is necessary for establishing secure connections to Cisco devices.

##

Steps to Test Cisco Device

Following these steps will allow you to test the Cisco device and create a new
user in the Cisco sandbox environment.

> ###

Login to Cisco Sandbox

  *   * Log in with your Cisco account credentials.

  * Select and launch the sandbox.

###

2\. Select and Launch the Device

  * Navigate to the sandbox catalog.

  * Select the appropriate sandbox for your Cisco device (e.g., Cisco IOS XE, etc.).

  * Launch the sandbox.

###

3\. Receive Details via Email or DevNet Environment

After launching the sandbox, you will receive an email with the connection
details or find them in the DevNet Environment under Quick Access.

###

4\. Download Cisco AnyConnect VPN

  * Download and install the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.

  * 

###

5\. Connect to the VPN

  * Open the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.

  * Enter the VPN connection details provided in the email or from the DevNet Environment.

  * Connect using the provided username and password.

###

6\. Store Developer Credentials

At this point, you will see Developer Credentials—a host, username, and
password. Store these values in a Keeper Security record of type `Login` named
as `Cisco Authentication Record`. You will need this Keeper Security record
name in order to run the post-rotation script.

###

7\. Add Custom Field to Cisco Authentication Record

Add a custom field named `network_id` to the Cisco Authentication Record and
set its value to the host address (e.g., `13.0.0.1`).

###

8\. Create a User

  * Open your terminal or SSH client.

  * Connect to the Cisco device using the provided IP address and credentials.

###

9\. Follow These Steps to Create a User

  1. Login with Admin User (developer):

Copy

         
         ssh developer@<device-ip>

  2. Enable privileged commands:

Copy

         
         enable

  3. Enter configuration mode:

Copy

         
         configure terminal

  4. Create a new user with a password:

Copy

         
         username <user> password <pass>

###

10\. Test the New User

Login with the new user:

Copy

    
    
    ssh <user>@<device-ip>

> **Note:** Replace `<user>` with the username you created and `<device-ip>`
> with the IP address of the Cisco device.

##

Setting up Rotation in your Vault

Once you have your prerequisites ready, make sure you cover the following:

  1. Make sure you satisfy all the prerequisites 

  2. Ensure that the post-rotation script references the Keeper Security record containing your Cisco admin credentials.

  3. Attach the post-rotation script to a Keeper Security PAM user record using the Keeper Security documentation. When this record has its secrets rotated, the post-rotation script will execute and update the password for the specified Cisco device user.

###

Step 1: Set Up Rotation Record

Create a new PAM User record to store Cisco User details whose password will
be rotated.

  * Set the username to match the Cisco device admin credentials 

  * Set the password to the current password set for the user.

  * Add a custom field named `network_id` to the Cisco Authentication Record and set its value to the host address (e.g., `13.0.0.1`).

###

Step 2: Add PAM Script

  * 

###

Step 3: Add NOOP Custom Field

  * Enable No-Operation (NOOP) atomic execution:

    * In the current PAM User record where user's details are stored, create a new custom text field labeled `NOOP` and set its value to `True`.

###

Step 4: Configure Password Rotation Settings

  1. **Rotation Type:** Set it to "On-Demand" for this example.

  2. **Password Complexity:** Leave it as default unless you have specific requirements.

  3. **Rotation Settings:** Point to the PAM Configuration set up earlier.

  4. **Administrative Credentials Record:** Can should be left empty

##

Python Script

PAM script to rotate Cisco Meraki user credentials:

Copy

    
    
    '''
    Password rotation script for Cisco meraki user accounts.
    
    This script is designed to rotate the password for a given Cisco Meraki User.
    It facilitates the automated updating of user password in your Cisco meraki environment.
    
    NOTE: If spaces are present in the path to the python interpreter, the script will fail to execute.
        This is a known limitation of the shebang line in Linux and you will need to create a symlink
        to the python interpreter in a path that does not contain spaces.
        For example: sudo ln -s "/usr/local/bin/my python3.7" /usr/local/bin/pam_rotation_venv_python3

The above script for the Cisco Post-Rotation Script can be also found here:

##

Rotating Cisco Meraki Network User Credentials

**Note:** The user whose password is getting rotated should not be an

**Note:** If you want to use a virtual environment, add a shebang line at the

Go to the

Get detailed connection instructions .

Attach the below that will perform the password rotation. The script has
additional comments inside that describe each line.
