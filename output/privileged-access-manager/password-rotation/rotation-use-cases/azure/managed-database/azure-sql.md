Overview

In this guide, you'll learn how to rotate passwords for Azure SQL Database
Users and Admin accounts on your Azure environment using Keeper Rotation.
Azure SQL is an Azure managed resource where the SQL Admin Credentials are
defined in the **PAM Database** record type and the configurations of the SQL
Users are defined in the **PAM User** record type.

For Azure Managed SQL database, the Azure SDK will be used to rotate the
password of Database Admin Accounts. To rotate the passwords of Regular
Database Users, Keeper connects to the DB instance with the linked admin
credentials and executes the necessary SQL statements to change the password.

  * See the [Azure Overview](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/password-rotation/rotation-use-cases/azure) for a high level overview and getting started with Azure

##

Prerequisites

This guide assumes the following tasks have already taken place:

  * [Rotation enforcements](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/enforcement-policies) are configured for your role

  * A Keeper Secrets Manager [application](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/applications) has been created

  * Your Azure environment is [configured](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/pam-configuration/azure-environment-setup) per our documentation

  * Your [Keeper Gateway](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/gateways) is online

  * The Keeper Gateway is able to communicate with your Azure SQL Server Database

  * If the Gateway is installed on a Linux or macOS server, install the [Microsoft ODBC driver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16)

##

1\. Set up a PAM Database Record

The **PAM Database** record links to admin credentials and contains the
necessary configurations to connect to the SQL Server on Azure. Keeper
Rotation will use these provided configurations to rotate passwords of regular
database user accounts in the Azure SQL Server instance. These provided admin
credentials need to also have sufficient database permissions to successfully
change the credentials of the database user accounts.

The following table lists all the **required** fields on the **PAM Database**
Record:

Field

Description

**Title**

Keeper record title Ex: `Azure SQL Admin`

**Hostname or IP Address**

The Database Server name i.e `testdb-sql.mssql.database.azure.com`

**Port**

For default ports, see port mapping Ex: `1433`

**Use SSL**

Check to perform SSL verification before connecting, if your database has SSL
configured

**Administrative Credentials**

PAM User providing the Admin account username and password that will perform
rotation. If the admin in the DB user table is in a Host other than %, add the
Host value to the user name as `USERNAME@SERVERNAME`

**Connect Database**

Optional database that will be used when connecting to the database server.
For example, MS SQL server requires a database and so this will default to
`master`.

**Database ID**

Name of the Azure Database Server i.e. `testdb-sql`

**Database Type**

`mssql`

**Provider Group**

Azure Resource group name

**Provider Region**

Azure Resource region i.e. `East US`

Note: Adding Provider Group, Provider Region, and Database ID will enable
managing the **PAM Database** Record through the Azure SDK.

This **PAM Database** Record with the linked admin credential needs to be in a
shared folder that is shared to the KSM application created in the pre-
requisites. Only the KSM application needs access to this privileged account,
it does not need to be shared with any users.

##

2\. Set up PAM Configuration

Note: You can skip this step if you already have a PAM Configuration set up
for this environment.

If you are creating a new **PAM Configuration** , login to the Keeper Vault
and select "Secrets Manager", then select the "PAM Configurations" tab, and
click on "New Configuration". The following table lists all the required****
fields on the **PAM Configuration** Record:

Field

Description

**Title**

Configuration name, example: `Azure DB Configuration`

**Environment**

Select: `Azure Network`

**Gateway**

Select the Gateway that is configured on the Keeper Secrets Manager
application and has network access to your Azure SQL database from the pre-
requisites

**Application** **Folder**

Select the Shared folder where the PAM Configuration will be stored. We
recommend placing this in a shared folder with the PAM User records.

**Azure ID**

A unique ID for this instance of Azure. This is for your reference and can be
anything, but its recommended to be kept short Ex: `Azure-Prod`

**Client ID**

The unique Application (client) ID assigned to your app by Azure AD when the
application was registered

**Client Secret**

The client credentials secret for the Azure application

**Subscription ID**

The UUID that identifies your subscription (i.e. Pay-As-You-GO) to use Azure
services.

**Tenant ID**

The UUID of the Azure Active Directory

For more details on all the configurable fields in the PAM Configuration
record, visit this [page](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-
started/pam-configuration).

##

3\. Set up one or more PAM User records

Keeper Rotation will use the linked credentials in the **PAM Database** record
to rotate the **PAM User** records on your Azure environment. The **PAM User**
credential needs to be in a shared folder that is shared to the KSM
application created in the prerequisites.

The following table lists all the required**** fields on the **PAM User**
record:

Field

Description

**Title**

Keeper record title i.e. `Azure DB User1`

**Login**

Case sensitive username of the account being rotated. If the user in the DB
user table is in a Host other than %, add the Host value to the user name as
`USERNAME@SERVERNAME`

**Password**

Account password is optional, rotation will set one if blank

**Connect Database**

Optional database that will be used when connecting to the database server.
For example, MS SQL server requires a database and so this will default to
`master`.

##

4\. Configure Rotation on the PAM User records

Select the **PAM User** record(s) from Step 3, edit the record and open the
"Password Rotation Settings".

  * Select the desired schedule and password complexity.

  * The "Rotation Settings" should use the **PAM Configuration** setup previously. 

  * The "Resource Credential" field should select the **PAM Database** credential setup from Step 1.

  * Upon saving, the rotation button will be enabled and available to rotate on demand, or via the selected schedule.

Any user with `edit` rights to a **PAM User** record has the ability to setup
rotation for that record.
