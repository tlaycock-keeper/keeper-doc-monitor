Overview

In this guide, you'll learn how to remotely rotate Active Directory or
OpenLDAP user accounts using KeeperPAM.

##

Prerequisites

This guide assumes the following tasks have already taken place:

  *   *   *   * The Keeper Gateway is able to communicate via LDAPS (port 636) or LDAP (port 389) to your directory.

###

1\. Set up a PAM Directory credential

Keeper Rotation will use the linked admin credential to rotate other accounts
in your directory. This account does not need to be a domain admin account,
but needs to be able to successfully change passwords for other accounts.

The linked admin credential needs to be in a shared folder that is shared to
the KSM application created in the pre-requisites. Only the KSM application
needs access to this privileged account, it does not need to be shared with
any users.

####

PAM Directory Record Fields

Field

Description

**Record Type**

PAM Directory

**Title**

Keeper record title

**Hostname or IP Address**

IP address, hostname or FQDN of the directory server. Examples: `10.10.10.10`,
`dc01.mydomain.local`

**Port**

`636` \- LDAPS is required for rotation on Active Directory. LDAP over port
`389` is insecure and should be avoided.

**Use SSL**

Must be enabled for use with Active Directory

**Administrative Credentials**

Linked PAM User credential used for performing the LDAP rotation. Example:
`rotationadmin`

**Domain Name**

Domain name of the Active Directory. Example: `mydomain.local`

**Directory Type**

Set to `Active Directory` or `OpenLDAP`

###

2\. Set up a PAM Configuration

Note: You can skip this step if you already have a PAM Configuration set up
for this environment.

Field

Description

**Title**

Configuration name, example: `My Active Directory`

**Environment**

Select: `Local Network`

**Gateway**

Select the Gateway that has access to your directory server

**Application Folder**

Select the Shared folder that contains the PAM Directory record

**Other fields**

###

3\. Set up PAM User records

KeeperPAM will use the credentials linked from the "PAM Directory" record to
rotate other "PAM User" records in your environment. The PAM User credential
needs to be saved in a shared folder that is assigned to the secrets manager
application. In the example below, the AD user `demouser` can be rotated.

####

PAM User Record Fields

Field

Description

**Record Type**

PAM User

**Title**

Keeper record title, e.g. `AD User - demouser`

**Login**

Username of the account being rotated. The format of the username depends on
the target system and type of service. Examples: `demouser
demouser@domain.local`

**Password**

Account password is optional. In most cases, a password rotation will not
require the existing password to be present. However there are some scenarios
and protocols which may require it.

**Distinguished Name**

Required for Active Directory and OpenLDAP directories. The LDAP DN for the
user, e.g. `CN=Demo User,CN=Users,DC=lureydemo,DC=local`

If you don't know the user's DN, the following PowerShell command can be used
to find it:

Copy

    
    
    Get-ADUser -Identity <username> -Properties DistinguishedName

###

4\. Configure Rotation on the Record

Select the PAM User record, edit the record and open the "Password Rotation
Settings".

  * The "Rotation" should be of type "General". 

  * The "PAM Resource" field should select the "PAM Directory" credential setup previously.

  * Select the desired schedule and password complexity.

  * Upon saving, the rotation button will be enabled and available to rotate on demand, or via the selected schedule.

###

Troubleshooting

An easy way to test if LDAP is properly configured is to run 'LDP.exe' and
test the connection. If this connection succeeds, then Keeper Rotation should
also succeed.

###

Testing with a Self-Signed Cert

For the purpose of testing an Active Directory user account rotation with
Keeper, it is necessary to ensure that the LDAPS connection is active and
using a valid certificate. If you are just testing and don't have a production
certificate, the instructions below provide you with a self-signed cert.

Using a self-signed certificate with AD is only for testing purposes, do not
use in production

1

###

Create a cert

From PowerShell running as an administrator, create a self-signed cert. Note
that the subject name and alternate names of the certificate must match with
the server hostname. In this example, the primary name is
`XYZ123.company.local` with alternate names `company.local` and `company`.

Copy

    
    
    New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName XYZ123.company.local,company.local,company, -CertStoreLocation cert:\LocalMachine\My

2

###

Install the cert

This script will locate the cert in the personal section of the certificate
manager and copy it into the trusted domains. Replace the `company` parameter
in the first line of this script with the domain in step 1.

Copy

    
    
    # Get the cert we just created
    $cert = Get-ChildItem -Path "Cert:\LocalMachine\My" | Where-Object {$_.Subject -like "*company*"}
    $thumbprint = ($cert.Thumbprint | Out-String).Trim()
    
    # Copy to NTDS through registry
    $certStoreLoc = 'HKLM:/Software/Microsoft/Cryptography/Services/NTDS/SystemCertificates/My/Certificates'
    if (!(Test-Path $certStoreLoc)) {
        New-Item $certStoreLoc -Force
    }
    Copy-Item -Path HKLM:/Software/Microsoft/SystemCertificates/My/Certificates/$thumbprint -Destination $certStoreLoc
    
    # Copy to Trusted Root store
    $rootStore = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store([System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.StoreName]::Root, 'LocalMachine')
    $rootStore.Open('ReadWrite')
    $rootStore.Add($cert)
    $rootStore.Close()

3

###

Restart NTDS

After restarting the NTDS service, the certificate should be installed.

Copy

    
    
    Restart-Service NTDS -force

4

###

Check the connectivity

Run 'LDP.exe' and make sure that you're able to connect to the local domain
over port 636 with SSL enabled.

are configured for your role

A Keeper Secrets Manager  has been created

Your  is online

A  associates an environment with a Keeper Gateway and credentials. If you
don't have a PAM Configuration set up yet for this use case, create one.

Depends on your use case. See the  section.

Any user with edit rights to a PAM User record and  allowing rotation has the
ability to set up rotation for that record.
