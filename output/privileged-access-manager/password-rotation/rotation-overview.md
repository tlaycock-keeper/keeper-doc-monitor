cli/command-reference/secrets-manager-commands#overview) using the
`enterprise-role` command:

Copy

    
    
    enterprise-role "Keeper Administrator" --enforcement "ALLOW_SECRETS_MANAGER":true
    enterprise-role "Keeper Administrator" --enforcement "ALLOW_PAM_GATEWAY":true
    enterprise-role "Keeper Administrator" --enforcement "ALLOW_PAM_ROTATION":true
    enterprise-role "Keeper Administrator" --enforcement "ALLOW_CONFIGURE_ROTATION_SETTINGS":true
    enterprise-role "Keeper Administrator" --enforcement "ALLOW_ROTATE_CREDENTIALS":true

###

Deploy a Keeper Gateway

If you haven't yet created a Keeper Gateway yet, a new Gateway deployment can
be created by clicking on **Create New** > **Gateway** from the Web Vault or
Desktop App (version 17.1 or newer). We have also posted a page describing how
to create a sandbox environment in [just a few
steps](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/quick-start-sandbox):

  * [Quick Start: Sandbox](https://docs.keeper.io/en/privileged-access-manager/privileged-access-manager/quick-start-sandbox)

###

Create an Application

When you use the Gateway using the **Create New** > **Gateway** feature,
Keeper will automatically create the Secrets Manager Application, Shared
Folders and PAM Configuration. In the Secrets Manager section of the vault,
you'll see the Application assigned to Shared Folders and also assigned to the
Gateway.

###

Create a PAM User record

A PAM user record holds a privileged account credential, password or private
key. For steps on creating a PAM User, [follow this
page](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/pam-
resources/pam-user). The example below shows a PAM User record for an admin
password on a Windows server. The PAM User record is added to a Shared Folder
containing user accounts.

###

Create a PAM Resource

A PAM Resource represents a Machine, Database or Directory.

###

Configure rotation settings

On the "Rotation Settings" section of the PAM User vault record, you can
configure how credential rotation is managed.

###

Password Rotation Settings

Field

Description

Required

Rotation Type

Specifies which type of rotation is being performed (and which protocol is
utilized).

**Required** "General", "IAM User" or "Run PAM Scripts Only". See below for
details.

PAM Resource

For General rotation type, specifies the PAM Resource record which can provide
the necessary privilege. For IAM User rotation type, specifies the PAM
Configuration utilizing cloud APIs.

**Required** only for "General" and "IAM User" rotation types

Rotation Schedule

Rotation can be performed on-demand or on a specific schedule.

For advanced scheduling, see the [cron spec](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-
manager/references/cron-spec).

Password Complexity

Applies to password-based rotations, not PEM keys.

Select "Show More" to control special characters and symbols.

###

Rotation Type

Keeper supports 3 different types of rotation:

  * **General:** Uses native protocols for performing the rotation, such as LDAP, Databases, SSH keys, etc.

  * **IAM User:** Uses the cloud-specific APIs for performing rotation, such as AWS IAM users and Azure managed resources. In this case, only the PAM Configuration is required since it contains the necessary 

  * **Run PAM scripts only:** Skips the standard rotation and only executes the attached PAM Scripts.

The rotation schedule can be set on a specific interval, or using a [cron
spec](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/references/cron-spec).

###

PAM Resource

To complete the Rotation setup, you need to select a resource, which depends
on the rotation type.

For a "General" rotation, the Keeper Gateway uses a native protocol for
performing the necessary rotation, and the rotation will be executed on the
associated PAM Resource supplied. If necessary, the rotation will use the
associated administrative credential on the PAM Resource.

In the example below, a Windows service account password is going to be
rotated on the associated Windows Server.

For an "IAM User" rotation type, the Keeper Gateway will use the referenced
PAM Configuration to determine which APIs and methods are used to perform the
rotation. In the example below, an IAM user in AWS will use the "AWS (US-
WEST-1)" configuration.

When using the IAM User rotation method, it is assumed that the Keeper Gateway
either inherits its privilege from the instance role policy, or through
explicit access keys that are provided on the PAM Configuration record.

###

In Summary:

  * The PAM User record holds the credential that is being rotated.

  * The Rotation Settings of the PAM User record references a specific PAM Machine, PAM Database or PAM Directory resource. This is the target resource where the rotation is performed.

  * The Keeper Gateway uses the Admin Credential associated to the PAM Machine, PAM Database or PAM Directory resource to perform the rotation with native protocols.

  * For AWS and Azure managed resources, Keeper uses Instance Role permission of the Gateway, or specific PAM Configuration secrets to perform the rotation with APIs.

###

Examples

Below are some examples of PAM User records.

  * Windows Domain Admin

  * Windows Domain User with post-rotation scripts

  * AWS IAM User

  * Database user

  * Azure AD User

##

Record Types for Rotation

The rotation of credentials is restricted to the [PAM
User](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/pam-
resources/pam-user) record type.

In previous versions of Keeper, rotation was permitted on PAM Machine, PAM
Database and PAM Directory records. In the latest version of KeeperPAM, you
will be prompted to separate the PAM Resources from the PAM User. See the
[Record Linking](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-
started/record-linking) documentation for more info.

When you have activated Keeper Secrets Manager or KeeperPAM, the following new
record types will be available to users:

  * **PAM User** Contains a login / password, private key, or both.

  * **PAM Directory** Information about your on-prem or cloud-based directory

  * **PAM Database** Self-hosted or managed cloud-based databases such as MySQL, SQL Server, etc.

  * **PAM Machine** Windows, Linux, macOS machines on-prem or in the cloud

  * **PAM Remote Browser** Remote browser isolation to protect web-based applications

All 5 record types can be added in the Vault, placed in folders, and shared
like any other Keeper records.

  * See [PAM Resources](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/pam-resources)

##

PAM Configurations

When rotation is activated, within the Secrets Manager screen of the vault
you'll see a section called **PAM Configurations**. A PAM Configuration is an
object which is contains the following:

  * **Environment** Local Network, AWS or Azure

  * **Keeper Gateway** Service which you install into your on-prem or cloud infrastructure

  * **Application Folder** Shared Folder which contains the Secrets Manager application and associated records

  * **Administrative Credentials** Keeper record which contains privileged credentials for performing rotation and discovery.

Customers may have any number of PAM Configurations, Applications and
Gateways.

  * More information on: [PAM Configuration](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/pam-configuration), [Applications](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/applications) and [Gateways](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/gateways)

##

How to Rotate a Password

The basic steps to rotation of passwords in any target environment are:

  * Add PAM User records to the Shared Folder

  * Add PAM Resource (Machine, Database, Directory) records to a Shared Folder

  * Configure rotation settings on each PAM User record

  * Create a Secrets Manager application

  * Assign the Secrets Manager application to the Shared Folders

  * Set the shared folder permissions containing the PAM Users from Read Only to Can Edit

  * Add a [Keeper Gateway](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/gateways) to the Secrets Manager application

  * Create a [PAM Configuration](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/pam-configuration) which ties everything together

  * Assign rotation settings to the [PAM User](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/getting-started/pam-resources/pam-user) records

##

Rotation on Keeper Commander

For automation of Rotation capabilities, [Keeper
Commander](/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/overview) supports KeeperPAM rotation
using the following commands:

  * [`pam action rotate`](/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/command-reference/keeperpam-commands)

  * [`pam action job-info`](/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/command-reference/keeperpam-commands)

Example:

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> pam action rotate -r 5NaygwI4LK1BDZmH3Ib
    Scheduled action id: MfKbPR3ac6A/oBDZpctpOg==
    
    My Vault> pam action job-info MfKbPR3ac6A/oBDZpctpOg== -g QPkRsR8KQm6_4vnHTcofZA
    Job id to check [MfKbPR3ac6A/oBDZpctpOg==]
    Execution Details
    -------------------------
    	Status              : finished
    	Duration            : 0:00:17.525641
    	Response Message    : Rotation completed for record uid 5NaygwI4LK1BDZmH3Ib
    My Vault>

##

Services and Scheduled Tasks

Keeper Rotation can also update the "log on" credentials for Windows service
accounts and scheduled tasks. See the [Service
Management](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/password-rotation/service-
management) documentation.

##

Record Import

Keeper supports importing in bulk from JSON format. See the [Importing PAM
Records](/en/keeperpam/privileged-access-manager/references/importing-pam-
