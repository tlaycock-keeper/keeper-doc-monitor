Python

.Net

GoLang

Copy

            KeyValueStorage storage = new LocalConfigStorage("ksm-config.json");
            try {
                // after the first run, this line can be removed
                initializeStorage(storage, oneTimeToken);

        console.log(records)
    
        const firstRecord = records[0]
        const firstRecordPassword = firstRecord.data.fields.find(x => x.type === 'password')
        console.log(firstRecordPassword.value[0])
    }
    
    getKeeperRecords().finally()

Copy

    
    
    package main
    
    // Import Secrets Manager
    import ksm "github.com/keeper-security/secrets-manager-go/core"
    
    func main() {
    
    	onetimeAccessCode := "[One Time Access Token]"
    
    	options := &ksm.ClientOptions{
    		// One time tokens can be used only once - afterwards use the generated config file
    		Token:  onetimeAccessCode,
    		Config: ksm.NewFileKeyValueStorage("ksm-config.json")}
    
    	sm := ksm.NewSecretsManager(options)
    
    	// Retrieve all password records (will also initialize config)
    	allRecords, _ := sm.GetSecrets([]string{})
    
    	// Get password from first record:
    
    	firstRecord := allRecords[0]
    
    	firstRecordPassword := firstRecord.Password()
    
    	print("Password: [", firstRecordPassword, "]")
    }

After a config file has been initialized, the One-Time Access Token should be
removed from code

This initialization code will create a JSON configuration file on the device
local storage with the following keys:

**Key**

**Description**

`hostname`

The destination host where your Enterprise tenant is located:

  * keepersecurity.com

  * keepersecurity.eu

  * keepersecurity.com.au

  * govcloud.keepersecurity.us

`clientID`

The hashed `clientKey` where `clientKey` is the Unique Client Device
Identifier

`privateKey`

Client Device Private Key

`serverPublicKeyId`

Keeper Infrastructure's Public Key ID

`appKey`

Application Private Key

`appOwnerPublicKey`

Application Owner's Public Key

The following is an example of a generated configuration file:

ksm-config.json

Copy

    
    
    {
      "hostname": "keepersecurity.com",
      "clientId": "ab2x3z/Acz0QFTiilm8UxIlqNLlNa25KMj=TpOqznwa4Si-h9tY7n3zvFwlXXDoVWkIs3xrMjcLGwgu3ilmq7Q==",

Create a Secret

The Secrets Manager SDKs provide the ability to create records in the Keeper
vault.

The UID of a shared folder that your Secrets Manager Application has access to
is required to create records. You must also have edit permissions in the
shared folder, and there must be at least one other record in the folder. The
new record will be placed in that folder. In the examples below, replace
`[FOLDER UID]` with the shared folder's UID.

Delete a Secret

Secrets Manager can be used to delete records from the Keeper Vault.

In order to delete a record, the Secrets Manager application must have access
to the shared folder that the record is in, and the application must have edit
capability. The record UID is required by Secrets Manager SDKs in order to
delete the record.

Script Integration

Keeper Secrets Manager CLI provides a wrapper function that executes any
arbitrary system call and replaces environmental variables with values from
the Keeper Vault.

##

Vault and Admin SDKs

For higher level functionality at the Vault and Administrative level, please
see the Vault SDKs page which contains links to various development tools.

The Secrets Manager SDK authenticates to the Keeper Vault using either the One
Time Access Token or using the generated keys within the local configuration
file. To generate one or more One Time Access Tokens from  use the `secrets-
manager client add` command.

Secrets Manager SDKs utilize a configuration file to hold connection tokens
and settings. The following code samples show how to create a configuration
file with the SDKs and an :
