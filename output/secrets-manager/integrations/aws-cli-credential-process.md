About

By default, the AWS CLI uses credentials stored in plaintext in
`~/.aws/credentials`. With this credential process, you can now use the Keeper
Vault to store your AWS credentials, removing the need to have them on disk.

Instead, AWS will use this executable to securely fetch your AWS credential
from your Vault using the Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM).

##

Features

  * Use a vaulted AWS Access Key to authenticate to the AWS CLI.

##

Prerequisites

In order to utilize this integration, you will need:

  * Keeper Secrets Manager access (See the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/quick-start-guide) for more details)

    * Secrets Manager add-on enabled for your Keeper account

    * Membership in a Role with the Secrets Manager enforcement policy enabled

  * A Keeper [Secrets Manager Application](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/about/terminology#application) with an Access Key shared to it

    * See the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/quick-start-guide#2.-create-an-application) for instructions on creating an Application

  * An initialized [Keeper Secrets Manager Configuration](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/about/secrets-manager-configuration)

    * This integration only accepts JSON format configurations

  * The [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed

##

Setup

###

Vault

The first step in the setup of the integration is to add you AWS `Access Key
ID` and your `Secret Access Key` to a record in your Vault. There is no built-
in record type for this kind of secret; however, you can [create a custom
record](https://docs.keeper.io/user-guides/record-types#custom-record-types)
for this purpose alone.

In order to create **new** custom Record Types, the user must be in an
Administrative role with the "**Manage Record Types in Vault** " [permission
activated](https://docs.keeper.io/enterprise-guide/record-types#custom-record-
types).

> Note: Field names are case-sensitive.

Once you have created your custom field, you can now use it to create a record
for your AWS Access Key. This record should be stored in a shared folder that
your KSM application has permission to access.

Once safely stored, you can delete the Access Key credentials from your AWS
credential file.

###

KSM

The integration expects a KSM Application Configuration file at either
`.config/keeper/aws-credential-process.json` or `aws-credential-process.json`
relative to the user's home directory. It must have access to a Shared Folder
containing the required AWS Access key.

For help in obtaining a KSM configuration in JSON format, [follow these
instructions](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-
manager/about/secrets-manager-configuration#creating-a-secrets-manager-
configuration). After creating a new device get corresponding `config.json`
and copy it into user's home folder as `aws-credential-process.json`

###

AWS Config

[Download the latest version](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/aws-
credential-process/tags) of the `keeper-aws-credential-process` executable
from the GitHub releases page and store that in a convenient location.

Now in your AWS configuration file, which is usually located at
`~/.aws/config`, add the following line to any profile you are using via the
CLI.

Copy

    
    
    # Add the UID for your AWS Access Key
    #credential_process = /path/to/keeper-aws-credential-process --uid <Record UID>
    credential_process = /opt/keeper-aws-credential-process-v0.1.1_linux_amd64  --uid <Record UID>

Make sure there's no residual aws cli
[configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-
configure-files.html) left on the machine which may be picked up automatically
or on credential process misconfiguration.

##

Usage

Once configured as above, the AWS CLI will automatically fetch your
authentication credential from the Keeper Vault. You can test that it works by
using any CLI command in which you have an appropriate IAM role for, such as:

Copy

    
    
    # List all s3 buckets
    aws s3 ls

If the command completes without error, congratulations, you are now fully set
up.

Feature Request / Report an Issue

This Credential Process is [open source and can be found on
GitHub](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/aws-credential-process). If you
need to report a bug or would like to request a feature to support more
authentication use cases, please [create a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/aws-credential-process/issues).
