##

Usage

###

Configure the Provider

The [Keeper Secrets Manager](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/) provider
is used to interact with the resources supported by Keeper Secrets Manager.
The provider needs to be configured with Keeper credentials before it can be
used.

Copy

    
    
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        secretsmanager = {
          source  = "keeper-security/secretsmanager"
          version = ">= 1.0.0"
        }
     }
    }
    
    provider "secretsmanager" {
      # Specify config contents as a string or load from file
      # credential = "<CONFIG FILE CONTENTS BASE64>"
      credential = file("/path/to/config.json")
    }

####

Configuration File Contents

  * `app_key` \- (Required) Application key.

  * `client_id` \- (Required) Client ID.

  * `private_key` \- (Required) Private key.

  * `hostname` \- (Optional) By default plugin will connect to `keepersecurity.com`

For more information on creating a Secrets Manager configuration, see the[
Configuration Documentation](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/about/secrets-
manager-configuration)

###

Get Secrets Using Data Sources

A data source is provided for each standard Keeper record type, which
facilitates easy fetching of secret credentials.

Data sources are accessed using the following format:

Copy

    
    
    data "<data_source_name>" "<record_type_reference>" {
        path = "<record_uid>"
    }

For example, using a Login type record:

Copy

    
    
    data "secretsmanager_login" "my_login_record" {
        path = "<RECORD_UID>"
    }

To access any additional custom fields or standard fields for user defined
record types use
[`secretsmanager_field`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/keeper-
security/secretsmanager/latest/docs/data-sources/field) data source

####

List of supported record types

Record Type

To see the fields available to each data source see [Record Types Data Source
Reference](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/keeper-
security/secretsmanager/latest/docs)

For more information on record types see [record types
documentation](/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/command-reference/record-
commands/default-record-types)

###

Accessing Record Fields

To access a secret credential saved to a field in a record, access the field
as part of the data source.

**Access the field of a typed record data source**

Use this format to access fields of a typed data resource

Copy

    
    
    ${ data.<data_source_name>.<record_type_reference>.<field> }

Example: access the password of a login type data source

Copy

    
    
    ${ data.secretsmanager_login.my_login_secret.password }

**Use the field data source to query any field in a record with Keeper
Notation**

Create a data source using the "secretsmanager_field" data source type, and
specify a field query in the path property.

Copy

    
    
    data "secretsmanager_field" "my_field" {
      path = "<record UID>/field/login"
    }

The field query uses the format: `"<UID>/field/<field type>"`

###

Creating Records With Resources

To create a record, use the resource corresponding to the record type that you
would like to use.

Each record resource requires at least a `folder_uid` and `title` as well as
values for each record field.

**Example login resource**

Copy

    
    
    resource "secretsmanager_login" "login" {
        folder_uid: "4PbDLf8UF4od87wJt-fdyQ"
        tile: "My Login Record"
        [...]
    }

####

Folder UID

To create records, Keeper Secrets Manager requires a folder UID so that it
knows where to create the new records.

A folder UID can be found in the Keeper Vault or by using Keeper Commander.

The given folder must by accessible by the Keeper Secrets Manager Application
being used by your Terraform plugin. The folder must also have at least one
record in it before being used by Keeper Secrets Manager.

####

Title

The record title.

####

Record Fields

The value and settings for each record field can be set in the resource. For
information on the available fields per record type, see the[ resource
definitions](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Keeper-
Security/secretsmanager/latest/docs).

Each field is represented as an object in the resource.

**Example login field**

Copy

    
    
    resource "secretsmanager_login" "login" {
        [...]
        login {
            value = "MyUsername"
            label = "Username"
    	required = true
        }
    }

####

Setting Field Values

Use the `value` field to set the intended value for each field. The format of
fields can differ, for example the `login` field type takes a string, while
the `name` field takes an object with "first", "middle" and "last" fields.

For reference of each field's value format see the [resource
documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Keeper-
Security/secretsmanager/latest/docs).

Setting Field Settings

Each field can be configured with various settings:

Field

Accepted Value

Description

label

string

The field label

required

boolean

if True, the field will be considered required by the Keeper Vault

privacy_screen

boolean

if True, the field will be hidden in the Keeper Vault

####

Password Field

The password field has some special features.

**Password Generation**

Records created using the Terraform plugin can have a password generated
automatically. To have the plugin generate a password, do not provide a
`value` field to the password, and instead use `generate = "True"`

The password generation can be configured to generate a password of a
specified length using the complexity field

Copy

    
    
    complexity {
        length: 16
    }

Additionally, password fields have an extra configuration setting:
`enforce_generation` which when true will make the Keeper Vault enforce that
the password can only be generated and not set by a user.

To have Terraform regenerate a password, it needs to notice a difference in
the generate field. To allow for triggering a difference, the generate field
accepts both "true" and "yes" values. Change from one to the other to trigger
a regeneration.

##

Examples

###

Read Credentials

This example provisions Keeper Secrets Manager, reads a login type data
source, and accesses each field of the data source.

Copy

    
    
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        secretsmanager = {
          source  = "keeper-security/secretsmanager"
          version = ">= 1.0.0"
        }
        local = {
          source = "hashicorp/local"
          version = "2.1.0"
        }
      }
    }
    
    provider "local" { }
    provider "secretsmanager" {
      # Specify config contents as a string or load from file
      # credential = "<CONFIG FILE CONTENTS BASE64>"
      credential = file("~/.keeper/ksm-config.json")
    }
    
    data "secretsmanager_login" "db_server" {
      path        = "<record UID>"
    }
    
    resource "local_file" "out" {
        filename        = "${path.module}/out.txt"
        file_permission = "0644"
        content         = <<EOT
    UID:    ${ data.secretsmanager_login.db_server.path }
    Type:   ${ data.secretsmanager_login.db_server.type }

    Password: ${ data.secretsmanager_login.db_server.password }
    URL:      ${ data.secretsmanager_login.db_server.url }
    TOTP:
    -----
    %{ for t in data.secretsmanager_login.db_server.totp ~}
    URL:    ${ t.url }
    Token:  ${ t.token }
    TTL:    ${ t.ttl }
    %{ endfor ~}
    FileRefs:
    ---------
    %{ for fr in data.secretsmanager_login.db_server.file_ref ~}

    Type:     ${ fr.type }
    Size:     ${ fr.size }
    Last Modified:  ${ fr.last_modified }
    Content/Base64: ${ fr.content_base64 }
    %{ endfor ~}
    EOT
    }
    
    output "db_secret_login" {
      value = data.secretsmanager_login.db_server.login
    }
