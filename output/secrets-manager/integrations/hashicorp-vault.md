About

The Keeper Secrets Manager HashiCorp Vault integration allows you to use
secrets from the Keeper Vault as a data store for **HashiCorp Vault**.

##

Features

  * Use Secrets from the Keeper Vault with HashiCorp Vault scripts and commands

  * Read secret information using HashiCorp Vault

  * Update secret information from HashiCorp Vault

##

Prerequisites

This page documents the Secrets Manager HashiCorp Vault integration. In order
to utilize this integration, you will need:

  *     * Secrets Manager add-on enabled for your Keeper subscription

    * Membership in a Role with the Secrets Manager enforcement policy enabled

  *     *   *     * The HashiCorp Vault integration accepts our Base64 format configurations

  * HashiCorp Vault command line, and a Vault server running

    * 

##

Installation

###

1\. Download the Secrets Manager Plugin

Download the latest integration release from the KSM GitHub page:

Look for a vault-plugin release in the list of releases that matched your
platform.

Unzip the plugin and place it into your HashiCorp Vault plugins directory. In
this example the folder is located at `C:\vault\plugins` (Windows) or
`/etc/vault/vault_plugins` (MacOS/ Linux)

###

2\. Register the Plugin with HashiCorp Vault

####

Development Mode

For testing the plugin or to allow quick development, development mode can be
used to quickly get the HashiCorp Vault CLI up and running.

WindowsLinux / MacOS

####

Start the HashiCorp Vault in dev mode

Copy

    
    
    vault server -dev -dev-plugin-dir=C:\vault\plugins

####

####

Enable the Secrets Manager Plugin

Copy

    
    
    vault secrets enable -path=ksm vault-plugin-secrets-ksm.exe

####

Start the HashiCorp Vault in dev mode

Copy

    
    
    vault server -dev -dev-plugin-dir=/etc/vault/vault_plugins

####

####

Enable the Secrets Manager Plugin

Copy

    
    
    vault secrets enable -path=ksm vault-plugin-secrets-ksm

HashiCorp Vault CLI development mode utilizes volatile in-memory storage. Any
actions taken on secrets in the Keeper Vault are immediate, but the plugin
will need to be re-enabled each time the HashiCorp Vault is started in dev
mode.

####

Production Mode

When ready to move to production, the plugin will need to be registered using
a SHA256 hash of the plugin.

WindowsLinux / MacOS

####

Register and Enable the Secrets Manager Plugin

Copy

    
    
    vault plugin register -command=vault-plugin-secrets-ksm.exe -sha256=<SHA256> secret vault-plugin-secrets-ksm
    vault secrets enable -path=ksm vault-plugin-secrets-ksm

####

####

Generating SHA256 Hash

You will need a hash of the plugin file to enable it with production HashiCorp
Vault servers. This hash can be generated for the Secrets Manager plugin.

Windows 7 and later comes with a built-in tool called CertUtil that can be
used to generate the SHA256 hash. This example will show how to generate a SHA
hash using CertUtil, but any tool that can generate a file hash in SHA256 will
work.

Copy

    
    
    CertUtil -hashfile C:\vault\plugins\vault-plugin-secrets-ksm.exe SHA256

####

Register and Enable the Secrets Manager Plugin

Copy

    
    
    vault plugin register -sha256=<SHA256> secret vault-plugin-secrets-ksm
    vault secrets enable -path=ksm vault-plugin-secrets-ksm

####

Generating SHA256 Hash

You will need a hash of the plugin file to enable it with production HashiCorp
Vault servers. This hash can be generated for the Secrets Manager plugin.

Using the built-in shasum function this can be generated like this:

Copy

    
    
    shasum -a 256 /etc/vault/vault_plugins/vault-plugin-secrets-ksm

Depending on your OS, you may use the `sha256sum` command instead

Copy

    
    
    sha256sum /etc/vault/vault_plugins/vault-plugin-secrets-ksm

###

3\. Configure a Secrets Manager Connection

Now that the HashiCorp Vault plugin is installed, a secure connection to the
Keeper Vault needs to be established so that secret credentials can be
accessed. To create this connection, a Secrets Manager configuration needs to
be created and assigned to the plugin.

####

Create a Secrets Manager Configuration

Once a configuration has been generated, set it to a variable to be used by
the Vault Plugin.

Copy

    
    
    vault write ksm/config ksm_config=<BASE64_CONFIG...>

##

Using the Plugin

###

List Secrets

Copy

    
    
    vault list ksm/records

The records will be shown in the following format:

Copy

    
    
    Keys
    ----
    UID RECORDTYPE: RECORDTITLE

Example:

Copy

    
    
    C:\Vault> vault list ksm/records
    Keys
    ----
    Hf6of4uo_2aD7IMjn4VPuA  login:  My Record
    Lv3B9ObAjxdpdBl0IJ3oow  folder: 4 record(s)
    Oq3fFu14hZY00d7sp3EYNA  MyCustomType:  My New Record (Custom record type)
    YDx58Q94dE1k9B367ZVz1w  databaseCredentials:    MySQL Credentials
    qe3EWYn840uR0bOMyZ2b0Q  login:  Dropbox Login

###

Get a Single Secret

Copy

    
    
    vault read ksm/record uid=<UID>

Example:

Copy

    
    
    C:\Vault> vault read ksm/record uid=Hf6r5Zuo_2aD7IMjn4VPuA
    Key       Value
    ---       -----
    fields    [map[type:login value:[username@email.com]] map[type:password value:[Pd08fi@1]]]
    notes     Example Login Record
    title     Sample KSM Record
    type      login

###

Read TOTP Code

Copy

    
    
    vault read ksm/record/totp uid=<UID>

Example:

Copy

    
    
    C:\Vault> vault read ksm/record/totp uid=32t82-oRu-79yplIAZ6jmA 
    Key    Value
    ---    ---
    TOTP   [map[token:392528 ttl:22 url:otpauth://totp/Generator:?secret=JBSWY3DPEZAK3PXP&issuer=Generator&algorithm=SHA1&digits=6&period=30]] 
    UID    32t82-oRu-79yplIAZ6jmA

###

Update a Secret

To update an existing secret, use the following command, passing in JSON data
that represents the updated secret's information. The corresponding record in
the Keeper Vault will be updated to match the JSON data passed.

Copy

    
    
    vault write -format=json ksm/record uid=<UID> data=@update.json

In this example, the updated data is passed in from a file, this is
recommended for cleaner and more simple CLI commands. The JSON data can be
passed in on the command line, but quotes will need to be escaped.

Example data file:

update.json

Copy

    
    
    {
      "fields": [
        {
          "type": "login",
          "value": [
            "username@email.com"
          ]
        },
        {
          "type": "password",
          "value": [
            "kjh4j3245DCD!d"
          ]
        }
      ],
      "notes": "\tThis record was updated with the Vault KSM plugin",
      "title": "Sample Updated Record",
      "type": "login"
    }

TIP You can see the current values of a secret in JSON format with this
command: `vault read -field=data -format=json ksm/record uid=<UID>`

###

Create a Secret

Similar to updating a secret, create a new secret by passing JSON data to the
following command:

Copy

    
    
    vault write -format=json ksm/record/create folder_uid=<UID> data=@data.json

In this example, the updated data is passed in from a file, this is
recommended for cleaner and more simple CLI commands. The JSON data can be
passed in on the command line, but quotes will need to be escaped.

Example data file:

data.json

Copy

    
    
    {
          "fields": [
                 {
          "type": "login",
          "value": [
           "username@email.com"
          ]
        },
        {
          "type": "oneTimeCode",
          "value": [
            "otpauth://totp/Generator:?secret=JBSWY3JP9HPK3PXP\u0026issuer=Generator\u0026algorithm=SHA1\u0026digits=6\u0026period=30"
          ]
        }
      ],
      "notes": "\tExample Record wth TOTP",
      "title": "Sample TOTP SECRET",
      "type": "login"
    }

###

Delete a Secret

Copy

    
    
    vault delete ksm/record uid=Oq3fFu14hZY00d7sp3EYNA
