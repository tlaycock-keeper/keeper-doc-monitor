Features

  * Dynamically retrieve secrets from the Keeper Vault when Docker containers execute

##

Prerequisites

This page documents the Secrets Manager Docker Runtime integration. In order
to utilize this integration, you will need:

  *     * Secrets Manager addon enabled for your Keeper account

    * Membership in a Role with the Secrets Manager enforcement policy enabled

  *     *   *   *     * 

##

About

Keeper Secrets Manager integrates with the Docker Runtime so that you can
dynamically retrieve a secret from the vault when the container executes.

The `**ksm**` command is used to set environment variables when the container
is started instead of hard-coding them into a deployment script. A real world
example of this implementation is demonstrated below.

##

Example: Provision MySQL network user account

The official MySQL dockerfile is below:

Copy

    
    
    FROM debian:buster-slim
    	
    ...
    ... INSTALL MySQL 8.0 SERVER
    ...
    	
    ENTRYPOINT ["docker-entrypoint.sh"]
    ​
    EXPOSE 3306 33060
    CMD ["mysqld"]

In the standard implementation, the ENTRYPOINT does the provisioning of the
container and will use environmental variables that are passed in to set up
MYSQL. The environmental variables referenced are the following:

  * MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD

  * MYSQL_USER

  * MYSQL_PASSWORD

  * MYSQL_DATABASE

The below steps will show how to initialize the MySQL database with secrets
that are stored in the Keeper Vault.

**Step 1: Create 2 Vault Records with Secrets**

Create two records in the Vault that are managed by the Secrets Manager
application. One record contains the root password. The other record contains
the regular user, password and database values.

Make sure to copy the Record UID that appears in the vault records. These are
used in Step 3 below when referencing the vault secrets.

**Step 2: Create dockerfile that builds on the default MySQL dockerfile**

We'll create a dockerfile that installs Keeper Secrets Manager CLI (`**ksm**`)
and then wraps the ENTRYPOINT with `**ksm exec**`

Copy

    
    
    FROM mysql:debian
    
    ARG BUILD_KSM_INI_CONFIG
    ARG BUILD_ROOT_UID
    ARG BUILD_USER_UID
    
    RUN apt-get update && \
      apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv && \
      apt-get clean
    
    # Avoid system installed modules that might interfer.
    ENV VIRTUAL_ENV /venv
    RUN python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip && \
      	python3 -m venv $VIRTUAL_ENV
    ENV PATH="$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin:$PATH"
    
    # Upgrade pip since the distro's Python might be old enough that it doesn't like to install newer modules.
    RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip
    
    # Install Keeper Secrets Manager CLI
    RUN pip3 install keeper-secrets-manager-cli
    
    # Import our configuration, decode it, and store it a place where ksm can find it.
    RUN ksm profile import $(printenv --null BUILD_KSM_INI_CONFIG)
    
    ENV MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD keeper://${BUILD_ROOT_UID}/field/password
    ENV MYSQL_USER          keeper://${BUILD_USER_UID}/field/login
    ENV MYSQL_PASSWORD      keeper://${BUILD_USER_UID}/field/password
    ENV MYSQL_DATABASE      keeper://${BUILD_USER_UID}/custom_field/database
    ​
    ENTRYPOINT ["ksm", "exec", "--", "docker-entrypoint.sh"]

**​Step 3: Create a shell script to execute the docker build**

To execute the docker build, the below script will pass in the Secrets Manager
device configuration, root user Record UID and network user Record UID from
the vault that contains the secrets.

Copy

    
    
    #!/bin/sh
    ​
    ​export CF=$(ksm profile export)
    
    docker build \
      --build-arg "BUILD_KSM_INI_CONFIG=${CF}" \
      --build-arg "BUILD_ROOT_UID=DvpMcO4xV5nZF6jqLGF1fQ" \
      --build-arg "BUILD_USER_UID=VNxZvvNAZ8j2mL4WIjEzjg" \
      -t mysql_custom \
      .

Example: Using KSM CLI Docker Image

  * `/cli/glibc/ksm` \- For standard GLIBC distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and CentOS.

  * `/cli/musl/ksm` \- For Alpine Linux.

For example, the following is simple framework showing how to access the CLI
binary.

Copy

    
    
    ---
    version: "2"
    services:
      init:
        image: keeper/keeper-secrets-manager-cli:latest
      main:
        image: ubuntu:latest
        volumes_from:
          - init:ro
        command: [ '/cli/glibc/ksm', 'exec', 'printenv', 'MY_LOGIN' ]
        environment:
          KSM_CONFIG: ewog ... M09IemdQMnc9Igp9
          MY_LOGIN: keeper://bf18xLR3aVut5eYy7oIZZZ/field/login
          LC_ALL: C.UTF-8
          LANG: C.UTF-8
        depends_on:
          init:
            condition: service_completed_successfully

The `init` service will load the CLI docker. The container will start, display
a CLI splash screen, and then will exit. Even though the container has
stopped, the `/cli` volume is still accessible from other containers.

Example: Using KSM CLI Docker With Other Vendor Docker Images

Similar to the examples above, the KSM CLI docker can be used to override the
entrypoint and command for another vendor's Docker image without creating a
custom Docker image.

This example, combines the first two examples.

For this example, it will be assumed the Docker image is being severed by the
Docker Hub repository and the images' Dockerfile is stored on GitHub.

####

Operating System Distribution

The first step is to determine what operating system distribution the vendor's
Docker image is built upon. Often this can be determined by the tag name. For
example, if the name has "alpine" in the image tag name, you'll know it's the
Alpine Linux distribution.

If the image tag name does not indicate the distribution, then on the Docker
Hub web page for the image, click on the tag name in the "Supported tags"
section. This will display the content of the Dockerfile. The **FROM**
statement will indicate the distribution the vendor has built their image
upon. If it is not apparent from the **FROM** statement, you man check the
Dockerfile of the **FROM** image due to inheritance.

MySQL 8.0.31 doesn't indicate the operating system distribution in the tag
name. On the MySQL Docker Hub page, the 8.0.31 tag links to their GitHub repo.
From the Dockerfile we can see the distribution is Oracle Linux.

The purpose of checking the distribution is to determine what version of the
**libc** library is being used. Most distributions use **GLIBC** but some,
mainly Alpine Linux, uses **MUSL.** This is needed to select the correct
binary from the KSM CLI Docker image. If you select the wrong one, you will
get an error like `exec /cli/musl/ksm: no such file or directory` or `exec
/cli/glibc/ksm: no such file or directory`. For our example, Oracle Linux is a
**GLIBC** distribution.

####

Entrypoint and Command

The next step is to determine the vendor's Docker image **ENTRYPOINT** and
**CMD**. The Dockerfile will list the **ENTRYPOINT** and/or **CMD**.

From the MySQL Dockerfile, the **ENTRYPOINT** is `["docker-entrypoint.sh"]`
and the **CMD** is `["mysqld"]`. This means the **ENTRYPOINT** will be
prepended to the **CMD** , so when the container is started `docker-
entrypoint.sh mysqld` will be executed.

####

`docker-compose.yml`

The docker-compose uses two services.

The **init** service loads the `keeper/keeper-secrets-manager-cli` __ Docker
image volumes. This image image will start and exit, however the volumes will
still be accessible after it exits.

The main services also will mount the volumes from the init service using the
`volumes_from`. The KSM CLI Docker image defined that volumes are exported,
and where they are mounted in the **main** service container. The binaries are
mounted in `/cli`, followed by the **libc** version, and the `ksm` binary
name.

Copy

    
    
    version: '3.0'
    services:
      init:
        image: keeper/keeper-secrets-manager-cli:latest
      main:
        image: mysql:8.0
        environment:
          KSM_CONFIG: "ewog .... RQ3pQMnc9Igp9"
          MYSQL_USER: "keeper://KOJLz4Wzbqfi9xUO-VMViA/field/login"
          MYSQL_PASSWORD: "keeper://KOJLz4Wzbqfi9xUO-VMViA/field/password"
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "keeper://KOJLz4Wzbqfi9xUO-VMViA/custom_field/Root Password"
          MYSQL_DATABASE: "keeper://KOJLz4Wzbqfi9xUO-VMViA/custom_field/Database"
        depends_on:
          init:
            condition: service_completed_successfully
        entrypoint: ["/cli/glibc/ksm", "exec", "docker-entrypoint.sh"]
        command: ["mysqld"]
        ports:
          - "3306:3306"
        volumes_from:
          - init:ro

Since the MySQL image uses the Oracle distribution, a **GLIBC** distribution,
the main service will use the `/cli/glibc/ksm` binary.

The **main** service will override the **ENTRYPOINT** and **CMD** of the MySQL
image. This is done using **entrypoint** and **command**. The entrypoint will
use the KSM CLI `exec` command to run the original **ENTRYPOINT**`docker-
entrypoint.sh`. The **command** is the same, however it needs to be set in the
`docker-compose.yml` else the service will just exit.

Based on the Docker image you are using, you may need override either
**ENTRYPOINT** or**CMD** , or both.

####

Results

When the services are brought up. The **init** service will run first and then
exit with a code 0, which means it exited successfully execute. Then the
**main** services will start up, execute the KSM CLI `exec` command and run
`docker-entrypoint.sh` with `mysqld`. At this point the environmental variable
have been replaced with secrets, MySQL has been provisioned, and `mysqld` is
running.

The official  allows a user to set the MySQL root password and create a
network accessible user via environment variables. The MySQL instance is then
provisioned when a container is run.

In the below dockerfile, the 4 environment variables are replaced using . We
are also passing in the Secrets Manager profile that points to the vault where
the secrets are stored.

The  includes a volume mount to both GLIBC (most Linux distributions) and MUSL
(Alpine Linux) CLI binaries. The volume is `/cli`. This directory can be
mounted into another container using the `volumes_from` in docker-compose or
`-v `from command line docker. The ksm executables exists in directory based
on the version of C library your Linux distribution is using.

The `main` service will mount the CLI docker's volume under the directory
`/cli` using `volumes_from`. The `command` is overridden to run the GLIBC
version of the KSM CLI. The `command` is using the `exec` function of the CLI.
That will replace environment variables environment variable, that use the ,
with a secret value. The `exec` command, of the CLI, is running the `printenv`
application. That will print the environment variable, **MY_LOGIN** , that has
been set to Keeper Notation, and has had its value replaced with a secret by
the `exec` command.

The **main** service will run after the **init** service. This is done by
using the docker-composes `depends_on` directive. This service contains
environment variables, with , that will be replaced by the KSM CLI `exec`
command and also includes the Base64 encoded configuration needed by the KSM
CLI. The **MYSQL_** environmental variables are used by the MySQL Docker image
to provision the database.
