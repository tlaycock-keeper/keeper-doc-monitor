    go get github.com/keeper-security/secrets-manager-go/integrations/gcp

###

2\. Configure **Google CKM** Connection

To enable secure authentication with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), generate a
Service Account key in JSON format. This credential file will serve as the
authentication mechanism for interacting with GCP services programmatically.

See the Google documentation for more information on generating keys:

###

3\. Add GCP Key Vault Storage to Your Code

Once GCP connection has been configured, You can fetch the Key to encrypt /
decrypt KSM configuration using integration and you need to tell the Secrets
Manager SDK to utilize the KMS as storage.

##

Using **GCP Key Vault Integration**

Once setup, the Secrets Manager GCP Key Vault integration supports all Secrets
Manager SDK functionality. Your code will need to be able to access the GCP
CKM Keys in order to manage the encryption and decryption of the KSM
configuration file. **Using Specified Connection credentials**

JavaJavaScriptPython.NetGo

To do this, create `GcpKeyValueStorage` instance and use this in
`SecretManagerOptions` constructor.

The `GcpKeyValueStorage` will require the name of the Secrets Manager
configuration file , gcp credential file and key details of Cloud Key
Management.

Copy

    
    
    import java.security.Security;
    import org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.BouncyCastleFipsProvider;
    import static com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.SecretsManager.initializeStorage;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsmanager.gcp.GcpKeyValueStorage;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsmanager.gcp.GcpSessionConfig;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.SecretsManagerOptions;
    public class Test {
    	public static void main(String args[]){
    	    String oneTimeToken = "One_Time_Token";
    	    String projectId = "projectId";
    	    String location = "cloud_region";
    	    String keyRing = "key_ring_name";
    	    String keyId = "key_id";
    	    String keyVersion = "key_version";
    	    String configFileLocation = "client_config_test.json";
    	    String credentialFileLocation = "<path_with_name_of_gcp_cred_file.json>";
    	    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleFipsProvider());
    		try{
    				GcpSessionConfig sessionConfig = new GcpSessionConfig(projectId, location, keyRing, keyId, keyVersion, credentialFileLocation);
    				GcpKeyValueStorage storage = new GcpKeyValueStorage(configFileLocation, sessionConfig);
    				initializeStorage(storage, oneTimeToken);
    				SecretsManagerOptions options = new SecretsManagerOptions(storage);	
    		}catch (Exception e) {
    				  System.out.println(e.getMessage());
    		}
    	}
    }

To do this, use `GCPKeyValueStorage` as your Secrets Manager storage in the
`SecretsManager` constructor.

The storage will require an `keyConfig` , `gcpsessionConfig`(generated by
`GCPKSMClient`) , and the name of the `Secrets Manager configuration file`
which will be encrypted by GCP Cloud Key Management.

Copy

    
    
     import {GCPKeyValueStorage,GCPKeyConfig,GCPKSMClient,LoggerLogLevelOptions} from "@keeper-security/secrets-manager-gcp";
        const getKeeperRecordsGCP = async () => {
            const gcpCredFile = "<path_with_name_of_gcp_cred_file.json>"
            const keyConfig2  = new GCPKeyConfig("<key_version_resource_url_1>");
            const keyConfig = new GCPKeyConfig("key_version_resource_url_2");
            const gcpSessionConfig = new GCPKSMClient().createClientFromCredentialsFile(gcpCredFile)
            let config_path = "<path to client-config.json>"
            let logLevel = LoggerLogLevelOptions.debug;
            const oneTimeToken = "<one_time_token>";
            const storage = await new GCPKeyValueStorage(config_path, keyConfig, gcpSessionConfig, logLevel).init();
            await initializeStorage(storage, oneTimeToken);
            const {records} = await getSecrets({storage: storage});
            console.log(records)
            const firstRecord = records[0];
            const firstRecordPassword = firstRecord.data.fields.find((x: { type: string; }) => x.type === 'bankAccount');
            console.log(firstRecordPassword.value[0]);
        }
        console.log("start")
        getKeeperRecordsGCP()
    

To do this, use `GCPKeyValueStorage` as your Secrets Manager storage in the
`SecretsManager` constructor.

The storage will require `gcp_key_config` (generated by `GCPConfig` ),
`gcp_session_config` object (generated by `GCPKMSClientConfig` ) and the name
of the `Secrets Manager configuration file` which will be encrypted by GCP
Cloud Key Management.

Copy

    
    
    from keeper_secrets_manager_storage.storage_gcp_kms import GCPKeyConfig, GCPKeyValueStorage,GCPKMSClientConfig
    from keeper_secrets_manager_core import SecretsManager
    gcp_key_config_1 = GCPKeyConfig("<key_resource_uri_1>")
    gcp_key_config_2 = GCPKeyConfig("<key_resource_uri_1>")
    gcp_cred_file_location_with_name = "<path_with_name_of_gcp_cred_file.json>"
    gcp_session_config = GCPKMSClientConfig().create_client_from_credentials_file(gcp_cred_file_location_with_name)
    config_path = "ksm_config.json"
    one_time_token = "<one_time_token>"
    storage = GCPKeyValueStorage(config_path, gcp_key_config_2, gcp_session_config)
    secrets_manager = SecretsManager(token=one_time_token,config=storage)
    all_records = secrets_manager.get_secrets()
    first_record = all_records[0]
    print(first_record)

To do this, use `GCPKeyValueStorage` as your Secrets Manager storage in the
`SecretsManager` constructor.

The storage will require an `keyConfig` (generated by `GCPKeyConfig` ),
`gcpSessionConfig` object (generated by `GCPKMSClient` ), and the name of the
`Secrets Manager configuration file` which will be encrypted by GCP Cloud Key
Management.

     public class Program {
       private static async Task getOneIndividualSecret() {
         Console.WriteLine("execution started");
         string key1ResourceName = "<KEY1ResourceURL>";
         string key2ResourceName = "<Key2ResourceURL>";
         string gcpConfigFilePath = "<GCP config file path with name>";
         var keyConfig = new GCPKeyConfig(key1ResourceName);
         var gcpSessionConfig = new GCPKMSClient().CreateClientFromCredentialsFile(gcpConfigFilePath);
         var ksmConfigPath = "ksm_config.json";
         var dotnet_access_token = "[One_Time_Token]";
         var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder => {
           builder.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug);
           builder.AddConsole();
         });
         var logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger < GCPKeyValueStorage > ();
         var gcp_storage = new GCPKeyValueStorage(keyConfig, gcpSessionConfig, ksmConfigPath, logger);
         SecretsManagerClient.InitializeStorage(gcp_storage, dotnet_access_token);
       }
       static async Task Main() {
         await getOneIndividualSecret();
       }
     }

To do this, use `NewGCPKeyVaultStorage` as your Secrets Manager storage in the
`NewSecretsManager`

The `NewGCPKeyVaultStorage` requires the following parameters to encrypt the
KSM configuration using GCP Cloud Key Management:

`ksmConfigFileName` : The file name of KSM configuration.

`credentialFileWithPath` : Provide file path with name of GCP credential file.

###

Change Key

We can change key that is used for encrypting the KSM configuration, examples
below show the code needed to use it

JavaJavaScriptPython.NetGoLang

Copy

    
    
    //The method changeKey(keyID) will be used to encrypt the KSM config file with new Key and version. 
    GcpKeyValueStorage storage = new GcpKeyValueStorage(configFileLocation, sessionConfig);
    String newKeyID = "<new Key ID>";
    boolean isChanged = storage.changeKey(keyId);
    System.out.println("Key Changed: "+isChanged); // Change the key for encryption/decryption

Copy

    
    
    // To change the GCP CKM key used for encryption, you can call the `changeKey` method on the `OciKeyValueStorage` instance.
    const storage = await new GCPKeyValueStorage(configPath,keyConfig,gcpSessionConfig).init();
    await storage.changeKey(keyConfig2);

Copy

    
    
    storage = GCPKeyValueStorage(config_path, gcp_key_config_2, gcp_session_config)
    storage.change_key(gcp_key_config_2)
    gcp_key_config_2 = "<new key id>"
    isChanged = storage.change_key(gcp_key_config_2)
    print("Key is changed " + isChanged)

Copy

    
    
    // To change the Google CKM key used for encryption, you can call the `ChangeKeyAsync` method on the `GCPKeyValueStorage` instance.
    // using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
    var gcp_storage = new GCPKeyValueStorage(keyConfig2, gcpSessionConfig, path,logger);
    bool isChanged = gcp_storage.ChangeKeyAsync(keyConfig1).Wait();
    Console.WriteLine(isChanged)

Copy

    
    
    // If you want to change the key not gcpp config, then pass nil in place of oracle config.
    cfg := gcpkv.NewGCPKeyVaultStorage(ksmConfigFileName, keyResourceName, credentialFileWithPath)
    updatedResourceName := "<Updated Key Resource Name>"
    isChanged, err := cfg.ChangeKey(updatedResourceName, "")
    	if err != nil {
    		// do something
    	}
    fmt.Printf("Key changed: %v\n", isChanged)

###

Decrypt Config

We can decrypt the config if current implementation is to be migrated onto a
different cloud or if you want your raw credentials back. The function accepts
a boolean which when set to true will save the decrypted configuration to file
and if it is false, will just return decrypted configuration.

JavaJavaScriptPython.NetGoLang

Copy

    
    
    GcpKeyValueStorage storage = new GcpKeyValueStorage(configFileLocation, sessionConfig);
    storage.decryptConfig(false); // Set false as a parameter to extract only plaintext.
    //OR 
    storage.decryptConfig(true); // Set true as a parameter to extract plaintext and save config as a plaintext.

Copy

    
    
    const storage = await new GCPKeyValueStorage(configPath,keyConfig,gcpSessionConfig).init();
    await storage.decryptConfig(true); // Set true as a parameter to extract plaintext and save config as a plaintext.
     // OR 
    await storage.decryptConfig(false);  // Set false as a parameter to extract only plaintext.

Copy

    
    
    storage = GCPKeyValueStorage(config_path, gcp_key_config_2, gcp_session_config)ig_file_location=config_path, oci_session_config=oci_session_config,logger=None)
    plaintext = storage.decrypt_config(False) # Set false as a parameter to extract only plaintext.
    print(plaintext)
    # OR 
    plaintext = storage.decrypt_config(True) # Set true as a parameter to extract plaintext and save config as a plaintext.
    print(plaintext)

Copy

    
    
    # To decrypt the config file and save it again in plaintext, you can call the `DecryptConfigAsync` method on the `OracleKeyValueStorage` instance.
    var gcp_storage = new GCPKeyValueStorage(keyConfig2, gcpSessionConfig, path,logger);
    var conf = await gcp_storage.DecryptConfigAsync(false); # Set false as a parameter to extract only plaintext.
    Console.WriteLine(conf);
    # OR
    var conf = await gcp_storage.DecryptConfigAsync(true); # Set true as a parameter to extract plaintext and save config as a plaintext.
    Console.WriteLine(conf);

Copy

    
    
    cfg := gcpkv.NewGCPKeyVaultStorage(ksmConfigFileName, keyResourceName, credentialFileWithPath)
    plainText, err := cfg.DecryptConfig(false)
    if err != nil {
    	// do something
    	fmt.Printf("Error while decrypting config: %v", err)
    }  
    plainText, err := cfg.DecryptConfig(true) // Set true as a parameter to extract plaintext and save config as a plaintext.
    if err != nil {
    	// do something
    	fmt.Printf("Error while decrypting config: %v", err)
    }
