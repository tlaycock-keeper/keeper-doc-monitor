Copy

    
    
    pip3 install keeper-secrets-manager-storage

oci is a prerequisite for the Oracle Key Vault integration. Install it to your
machine using pip.

Copy

    
    
    pip3 install oci

The Secrets Manager oracle KSM module can be installed using dotnet nuget
package manager.

Copy

    
    
    dotnet add package Keeper.SecretsManager.OracleKeyManagement

The Secrets Manager oracle KSM module Integration can be installed using

Copy

    
    
    go get github.com/keeper-security/secrets-manager-go/integrations/oracle

###

2\. Configure **Oracle KV** Connection

Ensure that you have an Oracle Key Vault instance available, and you know its
OCID (Oracle Cloud Identifier). By default, the OCI.DotNetSDK.Keymanagement
library will use the default OCI configuration file (`~/.oci/config`)

See the Oracle documentation for more information on setting up an Oracle
Keys:

<https://docs.oracle.com/en-
us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm>[](https://docs.oracle.com/en-
us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm)

Alternatively, You will need to add the correct configuration for your OCI
environment, including the details for accessing Oracle Key Vault.

The configuration file should look like this (replace with your actual
details):

[DEFAULT] user=ocid1.user.oc1..example_unique_id
fingerprint=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
key_file=/path/to/your/private/api/key.pem
tenancy=ocid1.tenancy.oc1..example_unique_id region=us-phoenix-1

###

3\. Add Oracle Key Vault Storage to Your Code

Once Oracle connection has been configured, You can fetch the Key to encrypt /
decrypt KSM configuration using integration and you need to tell the Secrets
Manager SDK to utilize the KMS as storage.

###

Using **Oracle Key Vault Integration**

Once setup, the Secrets Manager Oracle Key Vault integration supports all
Secrets Manager SDK functionality. Your code will need to be able to access
the OCI Keys in order to manage the encryption and decryption of the KSM
configuration file. **Using Specified Connection credentials**

JavaJavaScriptPython.NetGo

To do this, create `OracleKeyValueStorage` instance and use this in
`SecretManagerOptions` constructor.

The `OracleKeyValueStorage` will require the name of the Secrets Manager
configuration file with profile and configuration.

Copy

    
    
    import java.security.Security;
    import org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.BouncyCastleFipsProvider;
    import static com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.SecretsManager.initializeStorage;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretmanager.oracle.kv.OracleKeyValueStorage;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretmanager.oracle.kv.OracleSessionConfig;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.SecretsManagerOptions;
    import com.oracle.bmc.Region;
    
    
    class Test {
    	public static void main(String args[]){
    		String configPath = "<~/.oci/config>";
    		String cryptoEndpoint = "https://<>-crypto.kms.<oracle_cloud_region>.oraclecloud.com";
    		String vaultId = "<OCI VAULT ID>";
    		String keyId = "<OCI KEY ID>";
    		String keyVersionId = "<OCI KEY VERSION>";
    		String configFileLocation = "<KMS CONFIG FILE LOCATION>";
    		String profile = "<OCI CONFIG PROFILE EX: DEFAULT>"; // name of your profile
    		String oneTimeToken = "<Keeper Ont Time Token>";
    		String managementEndpoint =  "https://<>-management.kms.<oracle_cloud_region>.oraclecloud.com";
    		Region region = Region.<cloud_region>;
    		Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleFipsProvider());
    		try{
    			//set Oracle KV configuration, 
    			OracleSessionConfig oracleSessionConfig = new OracleSessionConfig(configPath, cryptoEndpoint, managementEndpoint, vaultId, keyId, keyVersionId, region);
    			//Get Storage 
    			OracleKeyValueStorage oracleKeyValueStorage = new OracleKeyValueStorage(configFileLocation, profile, oracleSessionConfig);
    			initializeStorage(oracleKeyValueStorage, oneTimeToken);
    			SecretsManagerOptions options = new SecretsManagerOptions(oracleKeyValueStorage);
    			//getSecrets(options)
    		}catch (Exception e) {
    			System.out.println(e.getMessage());
    		}
    	}
    }
    

To do this, use `OracleKeyValueStorage` as your Secrets Manager storage in the
`SecretsManager` constructor.

The storage will require an `Oracle config file location`, `Oracle
configuration profile`(if there are multiple profile configurations) and the
OCI `Oracle KMS endpoint` as well as the name of the `Secrets Manager
configuration file` which will be encrypted by Oracle KMS.

Copy

    
    
    import { OCISessionConfig, OciKeyValueStorage } from "@keeper-security/secrets-manager-oracle-kv";
        const getKeeperRecordsOCI = async () => {
            const oracleConfigFileLocation = "/home/...../.oci/config";
            const oracleProfile = "DEFAULT";
            const kmsCryptoEndpoint = "https://<>-crypto.kms.<location>.oraclecloud.com";
            const kmsManagementEndpoint = "https://<>-management.kms.<location>.oraclecloud.com";
            const ociSessionConfig = await new OCISessionConfig(oracleConfigFileLocation, oracleProfile, kmsCryptoEndpoint,kmsManagementEndpoint);
            const logLevel = LoggerLogLevelOptions.info;
            let config_path = "<Keeper config File Path>";
            const oneTimeToken = "<one time token>";
            const keyId = 'ocid1.key.oc1.iad.<>.<>';
            const keyVersionId = "ocid1.keyversion.oc1.iad.<>.<>";
            const storage = await new OciKeyValueStorage(keyId, keyVersionId, config_path, ociSessionConfig,logLevel).init();
            await initializeStorage(storage, oneTimeToken);
            const { records } = await getSecrets({ storage: storage });
            console.log(records);
            const firstRecord = records[0];
            const firstRecordPassword = firstRecord.data.fields.find((x: { type: string; }) => x.type === 'bankAccount');
            console.log(firstRecordPassword.value[0]);
        };
        console.log("start");
        getKeeperRecordsOCI();
    

To do this, use `OracleKeyValueStorage` as your Secrets Manager storage in the
`SecretsManager` constructor.

The storage will require a OCI Key ID, key version Id, as well as the name of
the Secrets Manager configuration file which will be encrypted by Oracle KMS
and OCI session configuration defined above.

    oci_session_config = OCISessionConfig(config_file_location, profile, kms_crypto_endpoint, kms_mgmt_endpoint)
    storage = OracleKeyValueStorage(key_id=key_id, key_version=key_version_id, config_file_location=config_path, oci_session_config=oci_session_config,logger=None)
    secrets_manager = SecretsManager(one_time_token,config=storage)
    all_records = secrets_manager.get_secrets()
    first_record = all_records[0]
    print(first_record)

To do this, use `OracleKeyValueStorage` as your Secrets Manager storage in the
`SecretsManager` constructor.

The storage will require an `Oracle config file location`, `Oracle
configuration profile`, and the `OCI Key Vault endpoint` as well as the name
of the `Secret Manager Configuration file` which will be encrypted by Oracle
Key Vault

To do this, use `NewOracleKeyValueStorage` as your Secrets Manager storage in
the `SecretsManager` constructor.

The NewOracleKeyVaultStorage requires the following parameters to encrypt the
KSM configuration using Oracle Vault:

`ksmConfigFileName` : The file name of KSM configuration.

`keyConfig` : Provide oracle key credentials `KeyID` and `KeyVersionID`.

`oracleConfig` : Provide oracle credentials `VaultManagementEndpoint`,
`VaultCryptoEndpoint`.

By default, the oci-keymanagement library will use the **default OCI
configuration file** (`~/.oci/config`).

Additional Options

###

Change Key

We can change key that is used for encrypting the KSM configuration, examples
below show the code needed to use it

JavaJavaScriptPython.NetGoLang

Copy

    
    
    //The method changeKey(keyID, keyVersion) will be used to encrypt the KSM config file with new Key and version. 
    
    String newKeyID = "<new Key ID>";
    String newKeyVersion = "<New Key Version>";
    OracleKeyValueStorage oracleKeyValueStorage = new OracleKeyValueStorage(configFileLocation, profile, oracleSessionConfig);
    oracleKeyValueStorage.changeKey(newKeyID, newKeyVersion); // Change the key for encryption/decryption

Copy

    
    
    // To change the Oracle KMS key used for encryption, you can call the `changeKey` method on the `OciKeyValueStorage` instance.
    const storage = await new OciKeyValueStorage(keyId, keyVersionId, config_path2, ociSessionConfig).init();
    await storage.changeKey(keyId2, keyVersionId2);

Copy

    
    
       storage = OracleKeyValueStorage(key_id=key_id, key_version=key_version_id, config_file_location=config_path, oci_session_config=oci_session_config,logger=None)
        
        new_key_id = "<new key id>"
        new_key_version_id = "<new key version>"
        isChanged = storage.change_key(new_key_id, new_key_version_id)
        print("Key is changed " + isChanged)

Copy

    
    
    // To change the Oracle KMS key used for encryption, you can call the `ChangeKeyAsync` method on the `OracleKeyValueStorage` instance.
    // using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
    
         var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder =>
                {
                    builder.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug);
                    builder.AddConsole();
                });
        var logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<OracleKeyValueStorage>();
        var oracle_storage = new OracleKeyValueStorage(keyId2,keyVersionId2,path,ociSessionConfig1,logger );

Copy

    
    
    // If you want to change the key not oracle config, then pass nil in place of oracle config.
    		updatedKeyConfig := &oraclekv.KeyConfig{
    			KeyID:        "ocid1.key.oc1.<>.<>.<>",
    			KeyVersionID: "ocid1.keyversion.oc1.<>.<>.<>.<>",
    		}
    	isChanged, err := cfg.ChangeKey(updatedKeyConfig, nil)

###

Decrypt Config

We can decrypt the config if current implementation is to be migrated onto a
different cloud or if you want your raw credentials back. The function accepts
a boolean which when set to true will save the decrypted configuration to file
and if it is false, will just return decrypted configuration.

JavaJavaScriptPython.NetGoLang

Copy

    
    
    OracleKeyValueStorage oracleKeyValueStorage = new OracleKeyValueStorage(configFileLocation, profile, oracleSessionConfig);
    oracleKeyValueStorage.decryptConfig(false); // Set false as a parameter to extract only plaintext.
    //OR 
    oracleKeyValueStorage.decryptConfig(true); // Set true as a parameter to extract plaintext and save config as a plaintext.

Copy

    
    
     const storage = await new OciKeyValueStorage(keyId, keyVersionId, config_path, ociSessionConfig).init();
     await storage.decryptConfig(true); // Saves to file
     const decryptedConfig = await storage.decryptConfig(true); // returns the decrypted config

Copy

    
    
     storage = OracleKeyValueStorage(key_id=key_id, key_version=key_version_id, config_file_location=config_path, oci_session_config=oci_session_config,logger=None)
     storage.decrypt_config(True)

Copy

    
    
    //To decrypt the config file and save it again in plaintext, you can call the `DecryptConfigAsync` method on the `OracleKeyValueStorage` instance.
     var conf = await oracle_storage.DecryptConfigAsync(true);
     Console.WriteLine(conf);   

Copy

    
    
    cfg := oraclekv.NewOracleKeyVaultStorage(ksmConfigFile, keyConfig, oracleConfig)
    	secrets_manager := core.NewSecretsManager(
    		&core.ClientOptions{
    			Token:  oneTimeToken,
    			Config: cfg,
    		},
    	)
    // Pass true if you want to save decryptconfig in ksm config file, else pass false.
    decryptedConfig, err := cfg.DecryptConfig(true) 

You're ready to use the KSM integration 👍
