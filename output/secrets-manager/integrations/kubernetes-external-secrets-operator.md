##

Overview

Kubernetes [External Secrets Operator](https://charts.external-secrets.io)
injects secrets into Kubernetes by synchronizing them from various external
APIs. This guide primarily focuses on the setup process for External Secrets,
facilitating the synchronization of secrets from your Keeper Vault into
Kubernetes.

The External Operator documentation can be found [at this
link](https://external-secrets.io/latest/provider/keeper-security/).

##

Features

  * Seamless synchronization of secrets from Keeper Vault into Kubernetes via External Secrets. 

  * Real-time access to secrets from Keeper Vault across all pods.

##

Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the setup, ensure you have the following:

  * Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) access (See the [Quick Start Guide](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/quick-start-guide) for more details)

    * Secrets Manager add-on enabled for your Keeper account

    * Membership in a Role with the Secrets Manager enforcement policy enabled

  * A Keeper [Secrets Manager Application](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/about/terminology#application) with secrets shared to it 

    * See the [Quick Start Guide](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/quick-start-guide#2.-create-an-application) for instructions on creating an Application

    * Make sure you add the proper permissions to your device in order to be able to read and write secrets

  * An initialized Keeper [Secrets Manager Configuration](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/about/secrets-manager-configuration)

  * The following commands installed:

    * [`helm`](https://helm.sh/) \- package manager for Kubernetes

    * [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) \- command line tool for Kubernetes 

##

Setup

###

Install External Secrets With Helm

To install External Secrets with Helm, run the following commands:

Copy

    
    
    helm repo add external-secrets https://charts.external-secrets.io
    
    helm install external-secrets \
        external-secrets/external-secrets \
        -n external-secrets \
        --create-namespace

###

Create Kubernetes Secret to store Base64 KSM Config

After creating a [Secrets Manager
Configuration](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-
manager/about/secrets-manager-configuration) for your device, you will have a
Base64 JSON string that contains connection tokens, encryption keys,
identifiers and domain information used to authenticate and decrypt data from
the Keeper Secrets Manager APIs.

The Base64 JSON config string will be set by External Secrets to authenticate
against Keeper Security and defined in a regular Kubernetes Secret.

Invoking the following command will create a Kubernetes Secret which is used
to authenticate to Keeper Secrets Manager:

Copy

    
    
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: ksm-config-secret # name of the k8s Secret where KSM config is stored
    type: Opaque
    data:
      ksm_config: "[REPLACE WITH YOUR BASE64 JSON string]"
    EOF

**Note:** Lines 2-8 in**** the above code snippet can be stored in a YAML file
and applied with the command `kubectl apply`. For example, you can store lines
2-8 in `secrets.yaml` and execute the following:

Copy

    
    
    kubectl apply -f secret.yaml

###

Create SecretStore

After creating a Kubernetes Secret with `ksm_config` defined to your Base64
JSON string, you can now create your SecretStore.

Invoking the following command will create your SecretStore:

Copy

    
    
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1   
    kind: SecretStore
    metadata:
      name: my-external-secrets-secretstore   # name of the SecretStore where retrieved secrets will be stored once fetched from Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM)
    spec:
      provider:
        keepersecurity:                       # name of the SecretStore provider, in this case KeeperSecurity
          authRef:
            name: ksm-config-secret           # name of the k8s Secret where KSM config is stored
            key: ksm_config                   # key in the k8s Secret where KSM config is stored
          folderID: "[SHARED FOLDER UID]"     # UID of the shared folder in KeeperSecurity where the records 
                                              #   are stored. Make sure the folder is shared into the KSM Application
    EOF

In the above code snippet, define `folderID` with the UID of the shared folder
where the records are stored in your Vault

In case of a `ClusterSecretStore`, Be sure to provide `namespace` for
`SecretAccessKeyRef` with the namespace of the secret that we just created.

**Note:** Lines 2-13 in**** the above code snippet can be stored in a YAML
file and applied with the command `kubectl apply`. For example, you can store
lines 2-13 in `secretstore.yaml` and execute the following:

Copy

    
    
    kubectl apply -f secretstore.yaml

###

Create ExternalSecret

Next, you need to create your ExternalSecret.

The following code snippet will create your External Secret and store the
values of the login & password field for the specified record into the
Kubernetes Secret. These fields are defined in the `target.template.data`
section and refreshed every 30 seconds. For a full list of supported fields,
visit this [page](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-
manager/about/field-record-types).

Copy

    
    
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
    kind: ExternalSecret
    metadata:
     name: ksm-external-secret
    spec:
     refreshInterval: 12h               # rate how often SecretManager pulls KeeperSecurity. 
                                        #   In this case every 12 hours, for the example. 
                                        #   We recommend this value to be 12h or more.
     secretStoreRef:                    # reference to the SecretStore defined above to authenticate against Keeper Security
       kind: SecretStore                # tells External Secrets the type of the secret store, should be same as the one defined above
       name: my-external-secrets-secretstore  
    
     dataFrom:                          # tells External Secrets which record to use to fetch from Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM)
       - extract:
           key: "[RECORD UID]"          # UID of the record in Keeper where the secrets are going to be fetched from
     target:                            # tells External Secrets the target location where to store the secrets once fetched from Keeper Security
       name: my-external-secrets-values # name of the k8s Secret to be created
       creationPolicy: Owner            # tells External Secrets to create the k8s Secret if it doesn't exist
       template:
         engineVersion: v2          
         data:
           username: "{{ .login }}"     # tells External Secrets to store the value of 
                                        # the login field in Keeper Security into the k8s Secret under the key username
           password: "{{ .password }}"  # tells External Secrets to store the value of 
                                        # the password field in Keeper Security into the k8s Secret under the key password
           name: "{{  (fromJson .name).first }} {{  (fromJson .name).middle }} {{  (fromJson .name).last }}" # decode json string into vars
    EOF

In the above code snippet, replace "[RECORD UID]" with the UID of your desired
record

For complex [types](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-
manager/about/field-record-types), like `name`, `phone`, `bankAccount`, which
does not match with a single string value, external secrets will return the
complete JSON string. Use the JSON template functions to decode.

**Note:** Lines 2-27 in**** the above code snippet can be stored in a YAML
file and applied with the command `kubectl apply`. For example, you can store
lines 2-27 in `externalsecret.yaml` and execute the following:

Copy

    
    
    kubectl apply -f externalsecret.yaml

####

Behavior

  * How a Record is equated to an ExternalSecret:

    * `remoteRef.key` is equated to a Record's ID

    * `remoteRef.property` is equated to one of the following options:

      * Fields: [Record's field's Type](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/about/field-record-types)

      * CustomFields: Record's field's Label

      * Files: Record's file's Name

      * If empty, defaults to the complete Record in JSON format

    * `remoteRef.version` is currently not supported.

  * `dataFrom`:

    * `find.path` is currently not supported.

    * `find.name.regexp` is equated to one of the following options:

      * Fields: Record's field's Type

      * CustomFields: Record's field's Label

      * Files: Record's file's Name

    * `find.tags` are not supported at this time.

###

Limitations

There are some limitations using this provider.

  * Keeper Secret Manager does not work with legacy non-typed records

  * Using tags `find.tags` is not supported by KSM

  * Using path `find.path` is not supported at the moment

###

Push Secrets

Push Secret will only work with a custom KeeperSecurity Record type
`ExternalSecrets`

####

Behavior

  * `selector`:

  * `secret.name`: name of the kubernetes secret to be pushed

  * `data.match`:

  * `secretKey`: key on the selected secret to be pushed

  * `remoteRef.remoteKey`: Secret and key to be created on the remote provider

    * Format: SecretName/SecretKey

###

Create PushSecret

To create a Keeper Security record from Kubernetes a `Kind=PushSecret` is
needed.

Copy

    
    
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1alpha1
    kind: PushSecret
    metadata:
      name: example
    spec:
      secretStoreRefs:
        - name: keeper
          kind: SecretStore
      refreshInterval: "1h"
      deletionPolicy: Delete
      selector:
        secret:
          name: secret-name # k8s secret to be pushed
      data:
        - match:
            secretKey: secret-key # k8s key within the secret to be pushed
            remoteRef:
              remoteKey: remote-secret-name/remote-secret-key # This will create a record called "remote-secret-name" with a key "remote-secret-key"
    EOF

**Note:** Lines 2-19 in**** the above code snippet can be stored in a YAML
file and applied with the command `kubectl apply`. For example, you can store
lines 2-19 in `pushsecret.yaml` and execute the following:

Copy

    
    
    kubectl apply -f pushsecret.yaml

Make sure there's only one record with the title `remote-secret-name` in the
KSM Application in use.

####

Limitations

  * Only possible to push one key per secret at the moment

  * If the record with the selected name exists but the key does not exists the record can not be updated.

##

Verifying Setup

After setting up your [Kubernetes Secret](/en/keeperpam/secrets-
manager/integrations/kubernetes-external-secrets-operator#create-kubernetes-
secret-to-store-base64-ksm-config), [SecretStore](/en/keeperpam/secrets-
manager/integrations/kubernetes-external-secrets-operator#create-secretstore),
and [ExternalSecret](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/integrations/kubernetes-
external-secrets-operator#create-externalsecret), you can extract secrets with
the command `kubectl get secrets`

In the above code snippets, the name of the secret is my-external-secrets-
values and we store the following record values:

Copy

    
    
    data:
           username: "{{ .login }}"                                      
           password: "{{ .password }}"

To get the login and password values, invoke the following command:

Copy

    
    
    $ kubectl get secret my-external-secrets-values -o jsonpath="{.data}"
    {"password":"a2lsbCB5b3U=","username":"SSB3aWxs"}

The above response is encoded, to decode, invoke the following:

Copy

    
    
    $ kubectl get secret my-external-secrets-values -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode
    pAs$w0rd

##
