Features

  * Store Secrets Manager configurations securely in Ansible Tower

  * Use Ansible Tower to manager and launch Ansible projects utilizing the [Secrets Manager Ansible plugin](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/integrations/ansible/ansible-plugin) which features:

    * Retrieving secrets from the Keeper vault to use in Ansible Playbooks

    * Updating the value of secrets in the Keeper Vault from Ansible

    * Copying files from the Keeper Vault

For a complete list of Keeper Secrets Manager features see the [Overview
](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/overview)

##

KSM Configuration

The first step in using Ansible Tower with Keeper Secrets Manager is to get
and initialize a Base64 configuration. The [Secret Manager
Configuration](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/about/secrets-manager-
configuration) document will explain how to get a configuration using the
[Keeper Secret Manager CLI](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/secrets-manager-
command-line-interface) or [Commander CLI.](/en/keeperpam/commander-
cli/overview)

Using **Commander CLI** , add a new device can generate a Base64 configuration
without using a one time access token.

Copy

    
    
    keeper secrets-manager client add --app MyApp --config-init b64

The Keeper Secrets Manager CLI requires a one-time access token. This can be
obtained from the Web Vault by adding a new device to an application.

Copy

    
    
    $ ksm init default US:XXXX

Another way using the `keeper_init_token` role included in the Keeper Secrets
Manager collection, which can used after Ansible Tower is setup. An example
will appear at the end of this document.

The Base64 configuration can be added to the inventories, hosts, or templates
variables sections. It can also be added to the playbook repository as an
Ansible secret. The variable name is `keeper_config.`

##

Vault Credential

With the Base64 KSM configuration we need to create a vault credential. Under
the **Resources** menu, select **Credentials** and click **Add**.

The credential will be used when the **Template** is setup.

##

Execution Environment

To use the Keeper Secrets Manager plugins in Ansible Tower an Execution
Environment containing the Keeper Secrets Manager SDK is required. This SDK is
included in the Docker image `keeper/keeper-secrets-manager-tower-ee`. In your
instance of Ansible Tower, select **Execution Environment** in the
**Administration** menu, then click **Add**.

The **Image** value is `docker.io/keeper/keeper-secrets-manager-tower-
ee:latest` or `docker.io/keeper/keeper-secrets-manager-tower-ee:<tag>` if
there is a specific tag version.

The value for **Pull** should be set to _Always pull container before running_
is you are using the **latest** tag. If you pin the tag to a specific tag
version of `keeper/keeper-secrets-manager-tower-ee` then set the value to
_Only pull the image if not present before running_.

##

Projects

###

Playbook Repository

####

Using the Keeper Security Manager collection from Ansible Galaxy

To use the Keeper Secrets Manager plugins in your projects, create a
`collections` directory in your source repository, if one does not already
exists. Then create, or add to, the file `requirements.yml` the following
value.

Copy

    
    
    ---
    collections:
      - keepersecurity.keeper_secrets_manager

####

Storing the KSM Configuration

The Base64 KSM configuration can be stored in numerous places inside of
Ansible Tower like in the inventories, hosts, and templates. The configuration
is encrypted when stored in these locations.

For this project, the KSM configuration will be stored as an encrypted secret
in the source repository. Add a YAML file called `secrets.yml` in a directory
called `defaults` located in the root directory of the repository.

In this file add a key called `keeper_config` with the Base64 configuration as
it's value.

Copy

    
    
    ---
    keeper_config: ewogICAgImNsaWVudElk ... Y0tleUlkIjogIjEwIgp9

Then encrypt the `secrets.yml` file using `ansible-vault`.

Remember the password, it will be needed in Tower for a Vault Credential.

Copy

    
    
    $ ansible-vault encrypt secret.yml
    New Vault password:
    Confirm New Vault password:
    Encryption successful

At this point, if you look at your secrets.yml file, it should be encrypted.

####

Playbook

The directory structure should look like the following.

Copy

    
    
    $ tree
    .
    ├── collections
    │   └── requirements.yml
    ├── defaults
    │   └── secrets.yml
    ├── playbook_1.yml
    └── playbook_2.yml
    

For our playbooks, the Keeper Secrets Manager collection is added to the
playbook collections. The first task is to include the `secrets.yml` using the
built-in action `include_vars`. That task also includes `no_log: True` to
prevent the KSM configuration from being logged. This task needs to be
performed before any of the plugins from the Keeper Secrets Manager
collection.

Ansible Tower uses it's own stdout callback plugin. So using keeper_redact
will not work. It's important to add `no_log: True` to tasks that may display
secrets in the log.

Copy

    
    
    ---
    - name: Playbook One
      hosts: all
      collections: 
        - keepersecurity.keeper_secrets_manager
    
      tasks:
        - include_vars:
            file: "defaults/secrets.yml"
          no_log: True
    
        - name: "Make User SSH Directory, if does not exists"
          file:
            path: "/home/user/.ssh"
            state: directory
            recurse: yes
    
        - name: "Copy SSH Keys"
          keeper_copy:
            notation: "OlLZ6JLjnyMOS3CiIPHBjw/field/keyPair[{{ item.notation_key }}]"
            dest: "/home/user/.ssh/{{ item.filename }}"
            mode: "0600"
          loop:
            - { notation_key: "privateKey", filename: "id_rsa" }
            - { notation_key: "publicKey",  filename: "id_rsa.pub" }

###

Project

Once you have added the collection to your source repository, a new
**Project** can be created.

Make sure to select the Execution Environment that you create that uses the
`keeper/keeper-secrets-manager-tower-ee` image.

In the example above, the source repository was Git with the appropriate
details. Your company may use a different source control.

After it is saved, sync the playbooks to your Ansible Tower instance.

##

Template

In your instance of Ansible Tower, select **Templates** in the **Resources**
menu, then click **Add**.

For **Projects** select the project that was just created that contain the
playbooks. For **Execution Environment** select the execution environment what
contains the _Keeper Secrets Manager Tower EE_ docker image. For **Playbook**
select a playbook from your source repository.

For Credentials select the Vault credential that will be used to decrypt the
`secrets.yml` file in the Project's source repository. You can also select the
credential to use for connection to your inventory servers.

Finish by clicking the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.

##

Launching a Template

The last step is to launch a template to create a job.

The `include_vars` task will import the KSM Base64 Configuration and decrypt
it. The `no_log: True` will hide the configuration from the log. If it is not
included, the configuration will be logged and viewable by anyone who has
access to Ansible Tower.

With the configuration now in the available variables, the `keeper_copy`
action can retrieve the public and private SSH key from the Keeper Vault and
copy them into location on the remote machine.

See the [Ansible Plugin documentation](/en/keeperpam/secrets-
manager/integrations/ansible/ansible-plugin) for all the Secrets Manager
capabilities available to Ansible

Give your Vault Credential a name, select **Vault** from the **Credential
Type** drop-down, type in the password that was used  the `secrets.yml` file
into the **Vault Password** field, then click **Save**.
