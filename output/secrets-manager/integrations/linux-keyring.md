Overview

Keyring is a Linux security feature that stores sensitive information, such as
passwords and secrets, and allows applications to securely access it.

The code base for the Linux Keyring Utility can be found here:

The binary needed to use the above utility can be found here:

To use the Linux Keyring Utility, you can either

  *   * or import it into your code base. 

Both use cases are covered below.

##

Linux Keyring Utility

###

Interface

There are two packages, `dbus_secrets` and `secret_collection`. The
`secret_collection` object uses the functions in `dbus_secrets`. It unifies
the D-Bus _Connection_ , _Session_ and _Collection Service_ objects to offer a
simple get/set/delete interface that the CLI uses.

##

Usage - Importing it into your codebase

The Go Language API has offers `Get()`, `Set()` and `Delete()` methods. The
first two accept and return `string` data.

###

Example (get)

Copy

    
    
    package main
    
    import (
        "os"
        sc "github.com/Keeper-Security/linux-keyring-utility/pkg/secret_collection"
    )
    
    func doit() {
        if collection, err := sc.DefaultCollection(); err == nil {
            if err := collection.Unlock(); err == nil {
                if secret, err := collection.Get("myapp", "mysecret"); err == nil {
                    print(string(secret))
                    os.Exit(0)
                }
            }
        }
        os.Exit(1)
    }

The `.DefaultCollection()` returns whatever collection the _default_ _alias_
refers to. It will generate an error if the _default_ alias is not set. It
usually points to the _login_ keyring. Most Linux Keyring interfaces allow the
user to set it.

The `.NamedCollection(string)` method provides access to collections by name.

###

Example (set)

Set takes the data as a parameter and only returns an error or `nil` on
success. It does not restrict the content or length of the secret data.

Copy

    
    
    if err := collection.Set("myapp", "mysecret", "mysecretdata"); err == nil {
        // success
    }

##

Usage - Binary Interface (CLI)

The Linux binary supports three subcommands:

  1. `get`

  2. `set`

  3. `del`

` _Get_` and `_del_` require one parameter; name, which is the secret _Label_
in D-Bus API terms.

`_Del_` accepts one or more secret labels and deletes all of them. If it
generates an error it will stop.

_Set_ also requires the data as a _single_ string in the second parameter. For
example, `set foo bar baz` will generate an error but `set foo 'bar baz'` will
work. If the string is `-` then the string is read from standard input.

###

Base64 encoding

` _Get_` and `_set_` take a `-b` or `--base64` flag that handles base64
automatically. If used, `_Set_` will encode the input before storing it and/or
_get_ will decode it before printing.

Note that calling `get -b` on a secret that is _not_ base64 encoded secret
will generate an error.

####

Examples

Copy

    
    
    # set has no output
    lkru set root_cred '{
        "username": "root"
        "password": "rand0m."
    }'
    # get prints (to stdout) whatever was set
    lku get root_cred
    {
        "username": "root"
        "password": "rand0m."
    }
    lkru set -b root_cred2 '{"username": "gollum", "password": "MyPrecious"}'
    lkru get root_cred2
    eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ICJnb2xsdW0iLCAicGFzc3dvcmQiOiAiTXlQcmVjaW91cyJ9
    lkru get -b root_cred2
    {"username": "gollum", "password": "MyPrecious"}
    cat ./good_cred.json | lkru set -b root_cred3 -
    lkru get root_cred3
    ewogICJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ICJhZGFtIiwKICAicGFzc3dvcmQiOiAicGFzc3dvcmQxMjMuIgp9

##

Errors

Error output goes to `stderr` so adding `2>/dev/null` to the end of a command
will suppress it.

###

**No keyring**

The login collection does not exist because the keyring does not exist. KDE
may create _kdewallet_ instead of _login_ like GNOME.

Copy

    
    
    Unable to get secret 'test_cred': Unable to retrieve secret 'test_cred' for application 'lkru' from collection '/org/freedesktop/secrets/collection/login': Object does not exist at path “/org/freedesktop/secrets/collection/login”

###

**No matching secret**

Copy

    
    
    Unable to get secret 'test_cred': Unable to retrieve secret 'test_cred' for application 'lkru' from collection '/org/freedesktop/secrets/aliases/default': org.freedesktop.Secret.Collection.SearchItems returned nothing

###

**No D-Bus Session**

There may not be a D-Bus Session to host the Secret Service. This happens when
the user is not logged into the GUI.

Copy

    
    
    Unable to get the default keyring: Unable to open a D-Bus session: The name org.freedesktop.secrets was not provided by any .service files

###

**No D-Bus**

The system may not host D-Bus. Several lightweight linux distributions ship
without it by default.

Copy

    
    
    Unable to get the default keyring: Unable to connect to the D-Bus Session Bus: exec: "dbus-launch": executable file not found in $PATH

Keeper provides a utility, the Linux Keyring Utility, that interacts with the
native Linux APIs to store and retrieve secrets from the Keyring using the .
This utility can be used by any integration, plugin, or code base to store and
retrieve credentials, secrets, and passwords in any Linux Keyring simply and
natively.

deploy the pre-built binary from the

The Linux Keyring Utility gets and sets _secrets_ in a Linux  using the  .

It has been tested with  and . It _should_ work with any implementation of the
D-Bus Secrets Service.

A secret may not be returned even though a secret with the same label exists.
If the secret was not created with lkru, it may not have the same . Namely
'Agent', 'Application', and 'Id'.
