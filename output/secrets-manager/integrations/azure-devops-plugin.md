Features

  * Retrieve secrets from the Keeper Vault from an Azure DevOps pipeline

  * Set secret credentials as build arguments or environment variables

  * Copy secure files from the Keeper Vault

##

Prerequisites

This page documents the Secrets Manager Azure DevOps integration. In order to
utilize this integration, you will need:

  *     * Secrets Manager addon enabled for your Keeper account

    * Membership in a Role with the Secrets Manager enforcement policy enabled

  *     *   *     * The Azure DevOps integration accepts JSON and Base64 format configurations

##

Installation

###

Install the Keeper Secrets Manager Extension

Enable the extension for your Azure organization by selecting an organization
and clicking "Download".

##

Access Secrets From Azure Pipelines

Since v1.0.4 extension allows use of a search by title syntax, where UID
portion could be replaced with the record title and must be escaped according
to Keeper Notation rules then it must follow YAML format specifications for
escaping special characters.

###

Create a Keeper Secrets Manager Task

Keeper Secrets Manager tasks look like this:

Copy

    
    
    - task: ksmazpipelinetask@1
      inputs:
        keepersecretconfig: $(secret_config)
        secrets: |
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i4x9Jcodg/field/password > var:var_password
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i4x9Jcodg/field/password > out:out_password
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i4x9Jcodg/field/password > out_password2
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i4x9Jcodg/file/cert.pem > file:/tmp/mycert.pem
    

In this example, `6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i4x9Jcodg` is the Record UID. In order to add a
task, you can create a task using a Task Form, or add it manually.

####

Add Task Using a Task Form

Search the Tasks menu for "Keeper Secrets Manager" to open the task form.

To fill in the task form and create a Keeper Secrets Manager Task, you will
need:

  *     * The Azure DevOps Extension accepts JSON and base64 configurations. 

  * 

Submit the form to add a task to your configuration automatically.

####

Manually add Task

To add a task manually to the pipeline configuration, follow this syntax:

Syntax

Example

Copy

    
    
    - task: <Task Name>
      inputs:
        keepersecretconfig: <Secrets Manager Configuration>
        secrets: |
          <Secrets Queries>

Copy

    
    
    - task: ksmazpipelinetask@1
      inputs:
        keepersecretconfig: $(secret_config)
        secrets: |
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/field/password > pazzword
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/field/login > LOGIN
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/file/build-vsix.sh > file:/tmp/build-vsix.sh

###

Keeper Secret Queries

Queries for secrets in the Keeper Vault use the following syntax:

####

Get a Standard Field Value

Syntax

Copy

    
    
    [UID]/field/[FIELD NAME] > [VARIABLE NAME]

Example

Copy

    
    
    6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/field/password > my_password

####

Get a Custom Field Value

Syntax

Copy

    
    
    [UID]/custom_field/[FIELD NAME] > [VARIABLE NAME]

Example

Copy

    
    
    6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/custom_field/notes > MyNotes

####

Get a Two-Factor Code

Syntax

`[UID]/field/oneTimeCode > [VARIABLE NAME]`

Example

Copy

    
    
    6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/field/oneTimeCode > MyOneTimeCode

####

Get a File

Syntax

Copy

    
    
    [UID]/file/[SECRET FILE NAME] > file:[OUTPUT FILE NAME]

Example

Copy

    
    
    6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/file/cert.pem > file:secret-cert.pem

####

####

Variable Types

When saving a secret from the Keeper vault as a variable on your Pipeline,
there are a few options for how to set those variables, depending on your
needs.

**OUT**

`out` (default) sets the secret to a variable which is accessible in any jobs
in the pipeline. If you do not define a variable type, `out` will be used by
default.

Copy

    
    
    6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/field/password > pazzword
    6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/field/password > out:my_password

**VAR**

`var` sets the secret to a local variable, usable within the same pipeline
job.

Copy

    
    
    6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/field/password > var:my_password

**FILE**

`file` sets the contents to a file. Usually used to access certificates and
other files from the Keeper Vault.

Copy

    
    
    6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/file/build-vsix.sh > file:/tmp/build-vsix.sh

**ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE**

`env` set the secret as an environment variable which the build machine can
access.

To do this, you first need to set the secret to a pipeline variable, then set
it as an environment variable in the bash task.

Copy

    
    
    - task: ksmazpipelinetask@1
      name: getKeeperSecrets
      inputs:
        keepersecretconfig: $(sm-config)
        secrets: |
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/field/password > var:var_password
          
    - bash: |
            echo "Using the mapped env variable: $MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR_PASSWORD"
        env:
            $MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR_PASSWORD: $(var_password)

##

Example Usage

###

Get Secrets From Keeper

This example pipeline sets secrets from the Keeper Vault to variables and
echoes them. Note that echoed passwords are masked.

Copy

    
    
    trigger:
    - master
    
    pool:
      vmImage: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    
    - task: ksmazpipelinetask@1
      name: setKsmSecretsStep
      inputs:
        keepersecretconfig: $(sm-config)
        secrets: |
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x4Jcodg/field/password > var:var_password
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x4Jcodg/field/password > out_password2
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x4Jcodg/field/password > out:out_password
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x4Jcodg/field/oneTimeCode > var:MyOneTimeCode
          6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x4Jcodg/file/build-vsix.sh > file:/tmp/build-vsix.sh
    
    - bash: |
        echo "Using an input-macro works                : $(var_password)"
        echo "Using an output variable (default method) : $(setKsmSecretsStep.out_password2)"
        echo "Using an output variable                  : $(setKsmSecretsStep.out_password)"
        echo "Using an output variable for totp         : $(setKsmSecretsStep.out_password)"
        echo "Using the mapped env var                  : $(MyOneTimeCode)"
        echo "Check injected secret file                : $(file /tmp/build-vsix.sh)"
      env:
        MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR_PASSWORD: $(var_password) # the recommended way to map to an env variable
      name: display_secret_values

###

Use Secrets in Multiple Jobs

This example gets passwords and files from Keeper, and utilizes those
passwords and files in another job.

Copy

    
    
    trigger:
    - master
    
    pool:
      vmImage: ubuntu-latest
    
    jobs:
    - job: ksmSecrets
      displayName: "Inject KSM Secrets"
    
      steps:
    
      - task: ksmazpipelinetask@1
        name: setKsmSecretsStep
        inputs:
          keepersecretconfig: $(sm-config)
          secrets: |
            6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/field/password > var:var_password
            6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/field/password > out:out_password
            6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/field/password > out_password2
            6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/file/mykey.pub > file:/tmp/public_key.pem
            6ya_fdc6XTsZ7i7x9Jcodg/file/mykey.pem > file:/tmp/private_key.pem
    
      - bash: |
          echo "Using an input-macro works                : $(var_password)"
          echo "Using an output variable (default method) : $(setKsmSecretsStep.out_password2)"
          echo "Using an output variable                  : $(setKsmSecretsStep.out_password)"
          echo "Using the mapped env var                  : $MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR_PASSWORD"
          echo "Check injected secret file                : $(file /tmp/public_key.pem)"
        env:
          MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR_PASSWORD: $(var_password) # the recommended way to map to an env variable
        name: display_secret_values
    
      - bash: |
          cat << EOF > decrypted.txt
          This is a decrypted message
          EOF
        name: create_text_file
    
      - bash: cat decrypted.txt

      - bash: cat decrypted2.txt
        name: view_decrpyted2_content
    
    
    - job: encryptFileTest
      dependsOn: ksmSecrets
      variables:
        # map the output variable from A into this job
        # Note:
        #   that files can't be shared between jobs each agent can run only one job at a time
        #   one job is an independent running individual, the communication between different 
        #   jobs requires the use of "middleware", like variable, artifact and etc.
        pwdFromKsmSecrets: $[ dependencies.ksmSecrets.outputs['setKsmSecretsStep.out_password'] ]
    
      steps:
        - bash: |
            echo "password retrieved from job 'ksmSecrets', step 'pwdFromKsmSecrets', out variable 'setKsmSecretsStep.out_password':$(pwdFromKsmSecrets)"

In order to access secrets from the Keeper Vault, add a task to your Azure
Pipelines YAML configuration file. Then query your records for the desired
fields. Secret queries use  and have the following syntax `KeeperNotation >
destination` where the destination location is defined by its prefix `var:`,
`out:` or `file:` see the examples below.

One or more  (See query syntax below)

While it is possible to simply copy a Keeper Secrets Manager configuration
into the pipeline, we recommend keeping the Secrets Manager configuration in
an Azure Key Vault that is accessible to your Azure Pipeline. See  to learn
more about Azure Key Vault.
