Download and Installation

###

Install With Maven or Gradle

GradleMaven

build.gradle

Copy

    
    
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.keepersecurity.secrets-manager:core:17.0.0+'
        implementation("org.bouncycastle:bc-fips:1.0.2.4")
    }

###

**Cryptographic Provider**

The Keeper Secrets Manager SDK expects the developer to use their required
cryptographic provider. As documented above, Keeper will use the default
cryptographic module of the Java runtime unless a specific provider is added.
In the examples here in this documentation, we are using the BouncyCastle FIPS
provider.

In the source code, ensure that the provider is loaded in the security
context:

Copy

    
    
    fun main() {
        Security.addProvider(BouncyCastleFipsProvider())
    ...

See the file `CryptoUtilsTest.kt` as shown in this
[example](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/secrets-
manager/blob/dcd96317304b8ddc2b17a649ac465f5cd408491a/sdk/java/core/src/test/kotlin/com/keepersecurity/secretsManager/core/CryptoUtilsTest.kt#L11)
on how to use a custom security provider.

###

**Source Code**

Find the Java/Kotlin source code in the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/secrets-
manager/tree/master/sdk/java/core)

###

Initialize Storage

Using token only to generate a new config (for later usage) requires at least
one read operation to bind the token and fully populate `config.json`

In order to retrieve secrets, you must first initialize the local storage on
your machine.

Copy

    
    
    initializeStorage(storage: KeyValueStorage, clientKey: String? = null, hostName: String? = null)

Parameter

Type

Required

Default

Description

`storage`

`KeyValueStorage`

Yes

`clientKey`

String

Optional

null

`hostName`

String

Optional

null

####

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    import static com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.SecretsManager.initializeStorage;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.LocalConfigStorage;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.SecretsManagerOptions;
    import java.security.Security;
    import org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.BouncyCastleFipsProvider;
    
    // oneTimeToken is used only once to initialize the storage
    // after the first run, subsequent calls will use "ksm-config.txt" file
    String oneTimeToken = "[One Time Access Token]";
    LocalConfigStorage storage = new LocalConfigStorage("ksm-config.txt");
    
    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleFipsProvider());
    
    try {
        initializeStorage(storage, oneTimeToken);
        SecretsManagerOptions options = new SecretsManagerOptions(storage);
        // Using token only to generate a config (for later usage)
        // requires at least one access operation to bind the token
        //getSecrets(options)
     } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e.getMessage());
     }

**Update Values in a Secret**

Record update commands don't update local record data on success _(esp.
updated record revision)_ so any consecutive updates to an already updated
record will fail due to **revision** mismatch. Make sure to reload all updated
records after each update batch.

**Update Secret**

Update SecretExample UsageTransactional updates

Copy

    
    
    updateSecret(options: SecretsManagerOptions, recordToUpdate: KeeperRecord);

Copy

    
    
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.KeeperRecord;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.KeeperSecrets;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.SecretsManagerOptions;
    import static com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.SecretsManager.*;
    
    // Ensure security provider is loaded
    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleFipsProvider());
    
    // get secrets
    SecretsManagerOptions options = SecretsManagerOptions(storage);
    KeeperSecrets secrets = getSecrets(options);
    
    // we'll update the first record
    KeeperRecord recordToUpdate = secrets.getRecords().get(0);
    
    // update password
    recordToUpdate.updatePassword("aP1$t367QOCvL$eM$bG#");
    
    // update title and notes
    recordToUpdate.data.title = "New Title"
    recordToUpdate.data.notes = "My Notes"
    
    // save changes
    updateSecret(options, recordToUpdate); 

Copy

    
    
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.KeeperRecord;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.KeeperSecrets;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.SecretsManagerOptions;
    
    import static com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.SecretsManager.*;
    
    ...
    
    // get secrets
    SecretsManagerOptions options = SecretsManagerOptions(storage);
    KeeperSecrets secrets = getSecrets(options);
    
    // we'll update the first record
    KeeperRecord record = secrets.getRecords().get(0);
    
    // rotate password on the record
    record.updatePassword("aP1$t367QOCvL$eM$bG#");
    
    // start a transaction
    updateSecret(options, record, transactionType = UpdateTransactionType.GENERAL);
    // rotate password on remote host
    boolean success = rotateRemoteSshPassword("aP1$t367QOCvL$eM$bG#");
    // complete the transaction - commit or rollback
    completeTransaction(options, record.recordUid, rollback = !success);

Update Secret is used to save changes made to a secret. Once updateSecret is
performed successfully, the changes are reflected in the Keeper Vault.

Update PasswordExample Usage

Copy

    
    
    recordToUpdate.updatePassword(password: String);
    
    SecretsManager.updateSecret(options, recordToUpdate);

Copy

    
    
    import static com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.SecretsManager;
    
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.SecretsManagerOptions;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.KeeperRecord;
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.KeeperSecrets;
    
    // get secrets
    SecretsManagerOptions options = SecretsManagerOptions(storage);
    KeeperSecrets secrets = getSecrets(options);
    
    // we'll update the first record
    KeeperRecord recordToUpdate = secrets.getRecords().get(0);
    
    // update password
    recordToUpdate.updatePassword("aP1$t367QOCvL$eM$bG#");
    
    // save changes
    SecretsManager.updateSecret(options, recordToUpdate);

Parameter

Type

Required

Default

Description

`password`

`String`

Yes

New password to set

**Update other fields**

Set ValueExample Usage

Copy

    
    
    //format
    RecordField.getValue().set(index, value)
    
    //example - Login field
    recordLogin.getValue().set(0, "New Login");

Copy

    
    
    // get field to edit
    Login recordLogin = (Login) recordToUpdate.getData().getField(Login.class);
    
    // update field value
    recordLogin.getValue().set(0, "New Login");
    
    // save changes
    SecretsManager.updateSecret(options, recordToUpdate);

Fields can have multiple values, which is accessed in a List. In this example
we are updating the login field, which only accepts one value, so we update
the one value in the values list.

###

Delete a Secret

The Java/Kotlin KSM SDK can delete records in the Keeper Vault.

Delete SecretExample

Copy

    
    
    deleteSecret(smOptions, recordUids);

Parameter

Type

Required

`smOptions`

`SecretsManagerOptions`

Yes

`recordUids`

`List<Sting>`

Yes

Copy

    
    
    // setup secrets manager
    val storage = LocalConfigStorage("ksm-config.json")
    //initializeStorage(storage, "<One Time Access Token>")
    val smOptions = SecretsManagerOptions(storage)
    
    // delete a specific secret by record UID
    deleteSecret(smOptions, List.of("EG6KdJaaLG7esRZbMnfbFA"));

###

Caching

To protect against losing access to your secrets when network access is lost,
the Java SDK allows caching of secrets to the local machine in an encrypted
file.

**Setup and Configure Cache**

In order to setup caching in the Java SDK, include a caching post function as
the second argument when instantiating a`SecretsManagerOptions` object.

The Java SDK includes a default caching function `cachingPostFunction` which
stores cached queries to a file.

Copy

    
    
    //create options with caching
    SecretsManagerOptions options = new SecretsManagerOptions(storage, SecretsManager::cachingPostFunction);
    
    //example get all secrets
    SecretsManager.getSecrets(options)

###

Folders

Folders have full CRUD support - create, read, update and delete operations.

###

Read Folders

    List<KeeperFolder> folders = SecretsManager.getFolders(options);

###

Create a Folder

Requires `CreateOptions` and folder name to be provided. The folder UID
parameter in `CreateOptions` is required - UID of a shared folder, while sub-
folder UID is optional and if missing new regular folder is created directly
under the parent (shared folder). There's no requirement for the sub-folder to
be a direct descendant of the parent shared folder - it could be many levels
deep.

        val folderUid: String,
        val parentUid: String? = null,
        val name: String
    )

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    import com.keepersecurity.secretsManager.core.*;
    SecretsManagerOptions options = new SecretsManagerOptions(new LocalConfigStorage("ksm-config.json"));
    CreateOptions co := new CreateOptions("[PARENT_SHARED_FOLDER_UID]");
    String folderUid = SecretsManager.createFolder(options, co, "new_folder");

###

Update a Folder

Updates the folder metadata - currently folder name only.

Copy

    
    
    updateFolder(options: SecretsManagerOptions, folderUid: String, folderName: String, folders: List<KeeperFolder> = getFolders(options))

Parameter

    SecretsManager.updateFolder(options, "[FOLDER_UID]", "new_folder_name");

###

Delete Folders

Removes a list of folders. Use `forceDeletion` flag to remove non-empty
folders.

When using forceDeletion avoid sending parent with its children folder UIDs.
Depending on the delete order you may get an error - _ex._ if parent force-
deleted child first. There's no guarantee that list will always be processed
in FIFO order.

Any folders UIDs missing from the vault or not shared to the KSM Application
will not result in error.

Copy

    
    
    deleteFolder(options: SecretsManagerOptions, folderUids: List<String>, forceDeletion: Boolean = false): SecretsManagerDeleteResponse

Parameter
