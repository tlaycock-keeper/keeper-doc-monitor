This example creates a login type record with a login value and a generated
password.

Replace '`[FOLDER UID]`' in the example with the UID of a shared folder that
your Secrets Manager has access to.

Copy

    
    
    # create a new login record
    new_login_record = RecordCreate('login', "Sample KSM Record: Python")
    # fill in login and password fields
    new_login_record.fields = [
        RecordField(field_type='login', value='username@email.com'),
        RecordField(field_type='password', value=generate_password())
    ]
    # fill in notes
    new_login_record.notes = 'This is a Python record creation example'
    # create the new record and get its UID
    record_uid = secrets_manager.create_secret('[FOLDER UID]', new_login_record)

This example creates a record with a custom record type.

Replace '`[FOLDER UID]`' in the example with the UID of a shared folder that
your Secrets Manager has access to.

Delete a Secret

The Python KSM SDK can delete records in the Keeper Vault.

Delete Secret

Example

Copy

    
    
    secrets_manager.delete_secret(record_uid)

Parameter

Type

Required

record_uid

string

Yes

Copy

    
    
    from keeper_secrets_manager_core import SecretsManager
    from keeper_secrets_manager_core.storage import FileKeyValueStorage
    
    # setup secrets manger
    secrets_manager = SecretsManager(
        token='<One Time Access Token>',
        config=FileKeyValueStorage('ksm-config.json')
    )
    
    # delete a specific secret by record UID
    secret = secrets_manager.delete_secret('EG6KdJaaLG7esRZbMnfbFA')

###

Caching

To protect against losing access to your secrets when network access is lost,
the Python SDK allows caching of secrets to the local machine in an encrypted
file.

**Setup and Configure Cache**

In order to setup caching in the Python SDK, include a caching post function
when creating a `SecretsManager` object.

The Python SDK includes a default caching function in `KSMCache` class which
stores cached queries to a local file thus serving as a disaster recovery
function (as long as there's network connectivity it always prefers network
over cached data and will use cache only if web vault is inaccessible). You
can create your own caching function using `KSMCache` as a starting point -
ex. one that prefers local cache over network access and provide own cache
management _(ex. refresh cached data once every 5 min)_

Copy

    
    
    secrets_manager = SecretsManager(
        token='<One Time Access Token>',
        config=FileKeyValueStorage('ksm-config.json'),
        custom_post_function=KSMCache.caching_post_function
    )

The default caching function in `KSMCache` class always stores last request
only - ex. filtered request on UID1 but on disconnect request UID2 from same
cache will return empty response _(although UID2 may be shared to the same KSM
app but it was not cached)_

Updating a record from cache (or creating new record) invalidates cached
record data and consecutive updates of the same record will fail. Batch
updates work as long as they modify different records. Always follow up cached
record updates with a call to `get_secrets` function to refresh cache _(and
pull updated metadata from vault like the new record revision etc.)_

###

Folders

Folders have full CRUD support - create, read, update and delete operations.

###

Read Folders

Downloads full folder hierarchy.

Copy

    
    
    get_folders()

**Response**

Type:****`List[KeeperFolder]`

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    from keeper_secrets_manager_core import SecretsManager
    from keeper_secrets_manager_core.storage import FileKeyValueStorage
    
    secrets_manager = SecretsManager(config=FileKeyValueStorage('ksm-config.json'))
    folders = secrets_manager.get_folders()

###

Create a Folder

Requires `CreateOptions` and folder name to be provided. The folder UID
parameter in `CreateOptions` is required - UID of a shared folder, while sub-
folder UID is optional and if missing new regular folder is created directly
under the parent (shared folder). There's no requirement for the sub-folder to
be a direct descendant of the parent shared folder - it could be many levels
deep.

Copy

    
    
    create_folder(create_options: CreateOptions, folder_name: str, folders=None)

Parameter

Type

Required

Default

Description

`create_options`

`CreateOptions`

Yes

The parent and sub-folder UIDs

`folder_name`

`str`

Yes

The Folder name

`folders`

`List[KeeperFolder]`

No

`None`

List of folders to use in the search for parent and sub-folder from
CreateOptions

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    from keeper_secrets_manager_core import SecretsManager
    from keeper_secrets_manager_core.core import CreateOptions
    from keeper_secrets_manager_core.storage import FileKeyValueStorage
    
    secrets_manager = SecretsManager(config=FileKeyValueStorage('ksm-config.json'))
    co = CreateOptions(folder_uid="[PARENT_SHARED_FOLDER_UID]", subfolder_uid="")
    new_folder_uid = secrets_manager.create_folder(co, "new_folder")

###

Update a Folder

Updates the folder metadata - currently folder name only.

Copy

    
    
    update_folder(folder_uid: str, folder_name: str, folders=None)

Parameter

Type

Required

Default

Description

`folder_uid`

`str`

Yes

The folder UID

`folder_name`

`str`

Yes

The new folder name

`folders`

`List[KeeperFolder]`

No

`None`

List of folders to use in the search for parent folder

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    from keeper_secrets_manager_core import SecretsManager
    from keeper_secrets_manager_core.storage import FileKeyValueStorage
    
    secrets_manager = SecretsManager(config=FileKeyValueStorage('ksm-config.json'))
    secrets_manager.update_folder("[FOLDER_UID]", "new_folder_name")

###

Delete Folders

Removes a list of folders. Use `force_deletion` flag to remove non-empty
folders.

When using `force_deletion` avoid sending parent with its children folder
UIDs. Depending on the delete order you may get an error - _ex._ if parent
force-deleted child first. There's no guarantee that list will always be
processed in FIFO order.

Any folders UIDs missing from the vault or not shared to the KSM Application
will not result in error.

Copy

    
    
    delete_folder(folder_uids: List[str], force_deletion: bool = False)

Parameter

Type

Required

Default

Description

`folder_uids`

`List[str]`

Yes

The folder UID list

`force_deletion`

`bool`

No

`False`

Force deletion of non-empty folders

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    from keeper_secrets_manager_core import SecretsManager
    from keeper_secrets_manager_core.storage import FileKeyValueStorage
    
    secrets_manager = SecretsManager(config=FileKeyValueStorage('ksm-config.json'))
    secrets_manager.delete_folder(["[FOLDER_UID1]", "[FOLDER_UID2]"], True)
