# .NET SDK

Detailed .Net SDK docs for Keeper Secrets Manager

##

Download and Installation

###

Prerequisites

> `dotnet add package Keeper.SecretsManager`

###

Source Code

Find the .Net source code in the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/secrets-
manager/tree/master/sdk/dotNet)

##

Using the SDK

###

Initialize Storage

Using token only to generate a new config (for later usage) requires at least
one read operation to bind the token and fully populate `config.json`

In order to retrieve secrets, you must first initialize the local storage on
your machine.

Copy

    
    
    SecretsManagerClient.InitializeStorage(storage: KeyValueStorage, clientKey: String? = null, hostName: String? = null)

Parameter

Type

Required

Default

Description

`storage`

`KeyValueStorage`

Yes

`clientKey`

String

Optional

null

`hostName`

String

Optional

null

####

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    var storage = new LocalConfigStorage("ksm-config.json");
    SecretsManagerClient. InitializeStorage(storage, "[One Time Access Token]");
    // Using token only to generate a config (for later usage)
    // requires at least one access operation to bind the token
    //var options = new SecretsManagerOptions(storage);
    //await SecretsManagerClient.GetSecrets(options);

###

    // get all matching records
    async Task<IEnumerable<KeeperRecord>> GetSecretsByTitle(SecretsManagerOptions options, string recordTitle)
    
    // get only the first matching record
    async Task<KeeperRecord> GetSecretByTitle(SecretsManagerOptions options, string recordTitle)

        var options = new SecretsManagerOptions(storage);
        var records = (await SecretsManagerClient.GetSecretsByTitle(
                options, "My Credentials")
            ).Records;
        foreach (var record in records)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(record.RecordUid + " - " + record.Data.title);
            foreach (var field in record.Data.fields)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("\t" + field.label + " (" + field.type + "): [" + String.Join(", ", field.value) + "]");
            }

Update Values in a Secret

Record update commands don't update local record data on success _(esp.
updated record revision)_ so any consecutive updates to an already updated
record will fail due to **revision** mismatch. Make sure to reload all updated
records after each update batch.

####

    var options = new SecretsManagerOptions(storage);
    
    //get secrets
    var secrets = (await SecretsManagerClient.GetSecrets(options)).Records;
    
    // get the first secret
    var secret = secrets[0];
    
    // rotate password on the record
    secret.updateFieldValue("password", "MyNewPassword");
    //start a transaction
    await SecretsManagerClient.UpdateSecret(options, secret, UpdateTransactionType.Rotation);
    // rotate password on remote host
    success = rotateRemoteSshPassword("MyNewPassword");

This example creates a record with a custom record type.

Replace '`[FOLDER UID]`' in the example with the UID of a shared folder that
your Secrets Manager has access to.

###

Delete a Secret

The .Net KSM SDK can delete records in the Keeper Vault.

Delete SecretExample

Copy

    
    
    DeleteSecret(smOptions, recordsUids);

Parameter

Type

Required

`smOptions`

`SecretsManagerOptions`

Yes

`recordsUids`

`string[]`

Yes

Copy

    
    
    using SecretsManager;
    
    // setup secrets manager
    var storage = new LocalConfigStorage("ksm-config.json");
    //SecretsManagerClient.InitializeStorage(storage, "<One Time Access Token>");
    var smOptions = new SecretsManagerOptions(storage);
    
    // delete a specific secret by record UID
    await SecretsManagerClient.DeleteSecret(smOptions, new string[] {"EG6KdJaaLG7esRZbMnfbFA"});

###

Caching

To protect against losing access to your secrets when network access is lost,
the .Net SDK allows caching of secrets to the local machine in an encrypted
file.

**Setup and Configure Cache**

In order to setup caching in the .Net SDK, include a caching post function as
the second argument when instantiating a`SecretsManagerOptions` object.

The .Net SDK includes a default caching function `cachingPostFunction` which
stores cached queries to a file.

Copy

    
    
    var options = new SecretsManagerOptions(storage, SecretsManagerClient.CachingPostFunction);
    var secrets = await SecretsManagerClient.GetSecrets(options);

###

Folders

Folders have full CRUD support - create, read, update and delete operations.

###

Read Folders

Downloads full folder hierarchy.

Copy

    
    
    Task<KeeperFolder[]> GetFolders(SecretsManagerOptions options)

**Response**

Type:****`KeeperFolder[]`

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    using SecretsManager;
    
    var options = new SecretsManagerOptions(new LocalConfigStorage("ksm-config.json"));
    var folders = await SecretsManagerClient.GetFolders(options);

###

Create a Folder

Requires `CreateOptions` and folder name to be provided. The folder UID
parameter in `CreateOptions` is required - UID of a shared folder, while sub-
folder UID is optional and if missing, a new regular folder is created
directly under the parent (shared folder). There's no requirement for the sub-
folder to be a direct descendant of the parent shared folder - it could be
many levels deep.

Copy

    
    
    Task<string> CreateFolder(SecretsManagerOptions options, CreateOptions createOptions, string folderName, KeeperFolder[] folders = null)

Parameter

Type

Required

Default

Description

`options`

`SecretsManagerOptions`

Yes

Preconfigured options

`createOptions`

`CreateOptions`

Yes

The parent and sub-folder UIDs

`folderName`

`string`

Yes

The Folder name

`folders`

`KeeperFolder[]`

No

`null`

List of folders to use in the search for parent and sub-folder from
CreateOptions

Copy

    
    
    public class CreateOptions {
        public string FolderUid { get; }
        public string SubFolderUid { get; }
    }

Copy

    
    
    public class KeeperFolder {
            public byte[] FolderKey { get; }
            public string FolderUid { get; }
            public string ParentUid { get; }
            public string Name { get; }
    }

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    using SecretsManager;
    
    var options = new SecretsManagerOptions(new LocalConfigStorage("ksm-config.json"));
    var co := new CreateOptions("[PARENT_SHARED_FOLDER_UID]");
    var folderUid = await SecretsManagerClient.CreateFolder(options, co, "new_folder");

###

Update a Folder

Updates the folder metadata - currently folder name only.

Copy

    
    
    Task UpdateFolder(SecretsManagerOptions options, string folderUid, string folderName, KeeperFolder[] folders = null)

Parameter

Type

Required

Default

Description

`options`

`SecretsManagerOptions`

Yes

Preconfigured options

`folderUid`

`string`

Yes

The folder UID

`folderName`

`string`

Yes

The new folder name

`folders`

`KeeperFolder[]`

No

`null`

List of folders to use in the search for parent folder

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    using SecretsManager;
    
    var options = new SecretsManagerOptions(new LocalConfigStorage("ksm-config.json"));
    await SecretsManagerClient.UpdateFolder(options, "[FOLDER_UID]", "new_folder_name");

###

Delete Folders

Removes a list of folders. Use `forceDeletion` flag to remove non-empty
folders.

When using forceDeletion avoid sending parent with its children folder UIDs.
Depending on the delete order you may get an error - _ex._ if parent force-
deleted child first. There's no guarantee that list will always be processed
in FIFO order.

Any folders UIDs missing from the vault or not shared to the KSM Application
will not result in error.

Copy

    
    
    Task DeleteFolder(SecretsManagerOptions options, string[] folderUids, bool forceDeletion = false)

Parameter

Type

Required

Default

Description

`options`

`SecretsManagerOptions`

Yes

Preconfigured options

`folderUids`

`string[]`

Yes

The folder UID list

`forceDeletion`

`bool`

No

`false`

Force deletion of non-empty folders

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    using SecretsManager;
    
    var options = new SecretsManagerOptions(new LocalConfigStorage("ksm-config.json"));
    await SecretsManagerClient.DeleteFolder(options, new string[]{"[FOLDER_UID1]", "[FOLDER_UID2]"}, true);
