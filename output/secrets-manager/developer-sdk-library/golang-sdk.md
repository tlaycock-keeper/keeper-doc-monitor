Prerequisites:

  * Shared folder UID

    * Shared folder must be accessible by the Secrets Manager Application

    * You and the Secrets Manager application must have edit permission

    * There must be at least one record in the shared folder

  * Created records and record fields must be formatted correctly

    *   * TOTP fields accept only URL generated outside of the KSM SDK

  * 

Create a Record

Create Record in Sub-folder

Login Record Example

Custom Type Example

Copy

    
    
    secretsManager.CreateSecretWithRecordData(recordUid, folderUid, record)

Parameter

Type

Required

Default

`recordUid`

`string`

No

auto generated random UID

`folderUid`

`string`

Yes

`record`

This example creates a login type record with a login value and a generated
password.

Replace `[FOLDER UID]` in the example with the UID of a shared folder that
your Secrets Manager has access to.

Copy

    
    
    // create a new login record
    newLoginRecord := NewRecordCreate("login", "Sample KSM Record: Go SDK")
    // fill in login and password fields
    password, _ := GeneratePassword(32,0,0,0,0)
    newLoginRecord.Fields = append(newLoginRecord.Fields,
        NewLogin("username@email.com"),
        NewPassword(password))
    // fill in notes
    newLoginRecord.Notes = "This is a Go record creation example"
    // create the new record 
    recordUid, err := secretsManager.CreateSecretWithRecordData("", "[FOLDER UID]", newLoginRecord)

Replace `[FOLDER UID]` in the example with the UID of a shared folder that
your Secrets Manager has access to.

This example creates a record with a custom record type.

Copy

    
    
    customLogin := ksm.NewRecordCreate("Custom Login", "Sample Custom Type KSM Record: Go SDK")
    password, _ := ksm.GeneratePassword(32, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    customLogin.Fields = append(customLogin.Fields,
    	ksm.NewHosts(ksm.Host{Hostname: "127.0.0.1", Port: "8080"}),
    	ksm.NewLogin("login@email.com"),
    	ksm.NewPassword(password),
    	ksm.NewUrl("http://localhost:8080/login"),
    	ksm.NewSecurityQuestions(ksm.SecurityQuestion{Question: "What is one plus one (write just a number)", Answer: "2"}),
    	ksm.NewPhones(ksm.Phone{Region: "US", Number: "510-444-3333", Ext: "2345", Type: "Mobile"}),

    	ksm.NewNames(ksm.Name{First: "John", Middle: "Patrick", Last: "Smith"}),
    	ksm.NewOneTimeCode("otpauth://totp/Example:alice@google.com?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP&issuer=Example"),
    )
    customLogin.Custom = append(customLogin.Custom,
    	ksm.NewPhones(ksm.Phone{Region: "US", Number: "510-222-5555", Ext: "99887", Type: "Mobile"}),
    	ksm.NewPhones(ksm.Phone{Region: "US", Number: "510-111-3333", Ext: "45674", Type: "Mobile"}),
    )
    customLogin.Notes = "\tThis custom type record was created\n\tvia Go SDK copied from https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/developer-sdk-library/golang-sdk"
    recordUid, err := sm.CreateSecretWithRecordData("", "[FOLDER UID]", customLogin)

###

Delete a Secret

The Go KSM SDK can delete records in the Keeper Vault.

Delete Secret

Example

Copy

    
    
    secretsManager.DeleteSecrets(recordUids)

Parameter

Type

Required

`recordUids`

`[]string`

Yes

Copy

    
    
    import ksm "github.com/keeper-security/secrets-manager-go/core"
    
    func main() {
    	// setup secrets manager
    	options := &ksm.ClientOptions{
    		// Token:  "<One Time Access Token>",
    		Config: ksm.NewFileKeyValueStorage("ksm-config.json")}
    	secretsManager := ksm.NewSecretsManager(options)
    	
    	// delete a specific secret by record UID
    	secrets, err = secretsManager.DeleteSecrets([]string{"EG6KdJaaLG7esRZbMnfbFA"})
    }

###

Caching

To protect against losing access to your secrets when network access is lost,
the Go SDK allows caching of secrets to the local machine in an encrypted
file.

**Setup and Configure Cache**

In order to setup caching in the Go SDK, use the function `SetCache(cache
ICache)` to set the cache to either one of the built-in memory or file based
caches or use your own implementation.

Copy

    
    
    type ICache interface {
    	SaveCachedValue(data []byte) error
    	GetCachedValue() ([]byte, error)
    	Purge() error
    }

The Go SDK includes a memory based cache and a file based cache for
convenience.

Copy

    
    
    options := &ksm.ClientOptions{Config: ksm.NewFileKeyValueStorage("ksm-config.json")}
    sm := ksm.NewSecretsManager(options)
    
    // Memory based cache
    memCache := ksm.NewMemoryCache()
    sm.SetCache(memCache)
    
    // File based cache
    fileCache := ksm.NewFileCache("ksm_cache.bin")
    sm.SetCache(fileCache)

###

Folders

Folders have full CRUD support - create, read, update and delete operations.

###

Read Folders

Downloads full folder hierarchy.

Copy

    
    
    GetFolders() ([]*KeeperFolder, error)

**Response**

Type:****`[]*KeeperFolder, error`

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    package main
    
    import ksm "github.com/keeper-security/secrets-manager-go/core"
    
    func main() {
    	options := &ksm.ClientOptions{Config: ksm.NewFileKeyValueStorage("ksm-config.json")}
    	sm := ksm.NewSecretsManager(options)
    	folders, err := sm.GetFolders()
    }

###

Create a Folder

Requires `CreateOptions` and folder name to be provided. The folder UID
parameter in `CreateOptions` is required - UID of a shared folder, while sub-
folder UID is optional and if missing new regular folder is created directly
under the parent (shared folder). There's no requirement for the sub-folder to
be a direct descendant of the parent shared folder - it could be many levels
deep.

Copy

    
    
    CreateFolder(createOptions CreateOptions, folderName string, folders []*KeeperFolder) (folderUid string, err error)

Parameter

Type

Required

Description

`createOptions`

`CreateOptions`

Yes

The parent and sub-folder UIDs

`folderName`

`string`

Yes

The Folder name

`folders`

`[]*KeeperFolder`

No

List of folders to use in the search for parent and sub-folder from
CreateOptions

Copy

    
    
    type CreateOptions struct {
    	FolderUid    string
    	SubFolderUid string
    }

Copy

    
    
    type KeeperFolder struct {
    	FolderKey []byte
    	FolderUid string
    	ParentUid string
    	Name      string
    }

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    package main
    
    import ksm "github.com/keeper-security/secrets-manager-go/core"
    
    func main() {
    	options := &ksm.ClientOptions{Config: ksm.NewFileKeyValueStorage("ksm-config.json")}
    	sm := ksm.NewSecretsManager(options)
    
    	co := ksm.CreateOptions{FolderUid: "[PARENT_SHARED_FOLDER_UID]", SubFolderUid: ""}
    	uid, err := sm.CreateFolder(co, "new_folder", nil)
    }

###

Update a Folder

Updates the folder metadata - currently folder name only.

Copy

    
    
    UpdateFolder(folderUid, folderName string, folders []*KeeperFolder) (err error)

Parameter

Type

Required

Description

`folderUid`

`string`

Yes

The folder UID

`folderName`

`string`

    import ksm "github.com/keeper-security/secrets-manager-go/core"
    
    func main() {
    	options := &ksm.ClientOptions{Config: ksm.NewFileKeyValueStorage("ksm-config.json")}
    	sm := ksm.NewSecretsManager(options)
    
    	err := sm.UpdateFolder("[FOLDER_UID]", "new_folder_name", nil)
    }

###

Delete Folders

Removes a list of folders. Use `forceDeletion` flag to remove non-empty
folders.

When using forceDeletion avoid sending parent with its children folder UIDs.
Depending on the delete order you may get an error - _ex._ if parent force-
deleted child first. There's no guarantee that list will always be processed
in FIFO order.

Any folders UIDs missing from the vault or not shared to the KSM Application
will not result in error.

Copy

    
    
    DeleteFolder(folderUids []string, forceDeletion bool) (statuses map[string]string, err error)

Parameter

Type

Required

Description

`folderUids`

`[]string`

Yes

The folder UID list

`forceDeletion`

`bool`

Yes

Force deletion of non-empty folders

**Example Usage**

Copy

    
    
    package main

    	sm := ksm.NewSecretsManager(options)
    
    	stats, err := sm.DeleteFolder([]string{"[FOLDER_UID1]", "[FOLDER_UID2]"}, true)
    }

Fields are found by type, for a list of field types see the  documentation.

See  to learn about Keeper Notation format and capabilities

Each record field type is represented by a class. Cast the field to the
corresponding class in order to correctly access the field's value. Check the
documentation for a list of field types.

See the  for expected field formats for each record type

After record creation, you can upload file attachments using
