# Profile Command

Setup and initialization of the Keeper Secrets Manager device profile

##

`profile` command

**Description:** Initialize and switch between device profiles. In order to
support multiple environments on the same device, you can also switch between
Secrets Manager device profiles.

**Parameters:**

Sub-command and options to run

format: `**ksm profile <sub-command>**`

**Sub-Commands:**

Sub-Command

Description

`init`

Initialize a new client device profile

`setup`

Setup a new profile from 3rd party external secrets manager like AWS.

`list`

List profiles that have been created, and note active profile

`export`

Export a configuration profile

`import`

Create a new configuration from an exported encrypted profile

`active`

Sets the active configuration profile

###

**init**

Initialize a client device profile.

Copy

    
    
    ksm profile init

The file `keeper.ini` file will be created in your current working directory.
For the Windows or macOS binary applications, the `keeper.ini` will be created
in the users home directory (${HOME} or `$env:USERPROFILE` environment
variables). The `keeper.ini` can be moved to the following locations:

  * The path defined by the environmental variable `**KSM_INI_DIR**`

  * The current directory

  * The user's home directory

    * `${HOME}`

    * `${HOME}/.config/ksm`

    * `$env:USERPROFILE`

  * Various system directories

    * `/etc`

    * `/etc/ksm`

    * `/etc/keeper`

    * `$env:APPDATA/Keeper`

    * `$env:ProgamData/Keeper`

    * `$env:ProgramFiles/Keeper`

Parameters:

  * `-t, --token <token>` one-time access token

  * `-h, --hostname <XX>` destination region

Defaults to US region. Customers hosted in other regions must set this value:

    * `US` (United States)

    * `EU` (Europe)

    * `AU` (Australia)

    * `JP` (Japan)

    * `CA` (Canada)

    * `US_GOV` (GovCloud) 

  * `--ini-file <FILENAME>` save the new profile to this file

  * `-p, --profile-name <NAME>` set profile name If not provided, the profile will be set as "default"

Typically, you will be initializing the KSM CLI with a token created in the
vault or in Keeper Commander. For example:

Copy

    
    
    ksm profile init --token XX:XXXXXXXX

To avoid exposing the token on the command line use `KSM_CLI_TOKEN`
environment variable. For example:

Copy

    
    
    ksm profile init --ini-file=/tmp/custom.ini --profile=non_default

Usage of `KSM_CLI_TOKEN` environment variable to provide one-time token allows
for selecting a custom INI file and custom profile _(to create/overwrite)_ and
can be overridden by `--token` option from command line.

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> secrets-manager client add --app MyApplicationName

###

**setup**

Setup a new profile to be loaded from external storage like the AWS Secrets
Manager. This is ideal when using Keeper Secrets Manager CLI from a cloud
instance. Using this method of authentication adds additional layers of
security.

There are 3 ways of integrating with external storage providers like AWS:

  * EC2 instance role (recommended)

  * AWS profile credentials

  * AWS custom keys

####

Method 1: EC2 instance role

To initialize the KSM CLI profile on an EC2 instance using the AWS EC2
instance role:

Copy

    
    
    ksm profile setup --type=aws

This creates a keeper.ini file which defines the secret key in AWS. For
example:

Copy

    
    
    ....
    
    [_default]
    storage = aws
    provider = ec2instance
    secret = ksm-config

By default, the secret key is assumed to be called `ksm-config`. You can
specify a different key value by editing the keeper.ini file or using the
`--secret` option. Example:

Copy

    
    
    ksm profile setup --type=aws --secret my-ksm-config

####

Method 2: AWS profile credentials

For example:

Copy

    
    
    ksm profile setup --type=aws --secret=ksm-config --credentials=profile --credentials-profile=default

####

Method 3: AWS custom keys

The KSM CLI can be configured to use a specific AWS Access Key / Secret Key
pair. In this scenario, the Access Key and Secret Key will be stored locally
in the `keeper.ini` file.

For example:

Copy

    
    
    ksm profile setup --type=aws --secret=ksm-config --credentials=keys --aws-access-key-id XXX --aws-secret-access-key XXX --region XXX

An additional flag `--fallback` allows you to specify falling back to the
default profile (from the AWS local configuration) if the initial credentials
fail.

####

Finishing the KSM CLI setup

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> secrets-manager client add --app "My KSM App" --config-init b64
    
    Successfully generated Client Device
    ====================================
    
    Initialized Config: [Base64 Config....]

Copy the provided configuration for use in the next step.

In order for this KSM device to authenticate against Keeper Secrets Manager,
the KSM configuration value in base64 format must be populated into the AWS
Secrets Manager. For example, using the AWS CLI:

Copy

    
    
    aws secretsmanager create-secret --name ksm-config --secret-string '[Base64 Config]'

Now, you can verify that KSM CLI works and can access secrets from your vault
using:

Copy

    
    
    ksm secret list
    
     UID                     Record Type          Title
     ----------------------- -------------------- --------------------------
     n9SdOX1cEyMj9Ttj3lsjYQ  pamUser              IAM Account: demouser
     WfxgS6E_bY_tzdIChYIsAA  login                Amazon AWS - john
     toAfybW5SsbhRT9LtZ7oyg  serverCredentials    QA Server

####

Additional setup options

`--ini-file <FILENAME>` save the new profile to this file instead of
keeper.ini. `-p, --profile-name <NAME>` set profile name. If not provided, the
profile will be set as "default"

###

**list**

List all available profiles for the current Client Device.

`ksm profile list`

Example:

Copy

    
    
    $ ksm profile list
    
      Active   Profile
     ======== ===============
               Production
      *        Test Server 1
               Test Server 2
               Local Dev

###

**export**

Export the current profile into a base64-encoded string.

`ksm profile export [--plain] [--file-format] [PROFILE NAME]`

optional parameters:

  * `--plain` Export profile without base64-encoding the string.

  * `--file-format` Export a profile to a specific file format. Available formats are:

    * ini - To be used by another instance of the CLI.

    * json - Can be used by the CLI and other Developer SDKs.

Example

Copy

    
    
    $ ksm profile export my_profile

Note: When using an external storage provider for KSM configuration, the
profile will not be exportable.

###

import

Import a client device profile from an encrypted base64-encoded string.

`ksm profile import [--output-file "INI filename"] <BASE64 CONFIG>`

optional parameters:

  * `--output-file <INI filename>` Where to create the INI configuration file. If not set, will be create in current directory.

Copy

    
    
    $ ksm profile import --output-file=my_profile BASE64_ENC_CONFIG

###

**active**

Set the currently active profile for this client device.

`ksm profile active <PROFILE NAME>`

Example:

Copy

    
    
    $ ksm profile active production
    
    production is now the active profile.

###

**Profiles within Containers**

If you are running the CLI inside of a containerized environment, you might
not have the ability to initialize a profile. If no INI config file is found
and the environment variable **KSM_TOKEN** is found, a default profile will be
auto-generated. A INI config file will be created and stored in the current
working directory. That can be overridden with the environment variable
**KSM_INI_DIR**.

###

**Default INI Filename**

The default name of the ini file is `keeper.ini` _,_ however this can
overridden by using the `**KSM_INI_FILE**` environment variable. By using
`**KSM_INI_DIR**` __ and __`**KSM_INI_FILE**` __ environment variables you can
completely change the location and name of the INI configuration file.

As described in the , you can create a token from the Commander CLI or from
the Keeper Vault interface. For example:

For this method, you need to install Keeper Secrets Manager CLI on a EC2
instance which has been configured with a role that has permission to read
specific AWS Secrets Manager secrets. We recommend setting up an EC2 role
policy that has the least permission available, to only read specific keys.
about AWS Secrets Manager access controls.

The KSM CLI can be configured to use a specific AWS profile that has been
previously initialized on this device with the `aws configure` .

For this method, the AWS profile credentials should be assigned to a role
which is limited to only read specific keys from the AWS Secrets Manager.
about AWS Secrets Manager access controls.

To complete the setup, a base64 KSM configuration value must be generated from
the Keeper Vault interface or the Keeper Commander CLI. This is described in
the .

For example, using the , this can be generated using a command such as the one
