     host      [{"hostName": "192.168.1.24", "port": "3306"}]
     login     user                                          
     password  ****                                
    

**Example 2:** Returning a Secret to the console with tabular format and
password unmasked

Copy

    
    
     $ ksm secret get --unmask --uid 8f8I-OqPV58o2r91wVgZ_A
     
     Record: 8f8I-OqPV58o2r91wVgZ_A
     Title: Production MySQL Database
     Record Type: databaseCredentials
    
     Field     Value                                         
     --------- ----------------------------------------------
     text      MySQL                                         
     host      [{"hostName": "192.168.1.24", "port": "3306"}]
     login     user                                          
     password  ksv#$0sbnb7W@b3VGCHb           
    

**Example 3** : Retrieving the password field from a secret. There are 2
different methods of doing this.

Copy

    
    
    # Using field searching
    $ ksm secret get -u SNzjw8tM1HsXEzXERCJrNQ -f password
    
    # Using query syntax
    $ ksm secret get -u 8f8I-OqPV58o2r91wVgZ_A \
      --json --query '$.fields[?(@.type=="password")].value'
    
    # Using query syntax for complex values
    $ ksm secret get -u SNzjw8tM1HsXEzXERCJrNQ \
      --json --query '$.fields[?(@.type=="keyPair")].value[0].publicKey'
       

**Example 4** : Retrieving a particular Custom Field value. There are 2
different methods of doing this.

Copy

    
    
    # Using field searching
    $ ksm secret get -u SNzjw8tM1HsXEzXERCJrNQ -f "API Key"
    
    # Using query notation
    $ ksm secret get --uid SNzjw8tM1HsXEzXERCJrNQ \
      --json --query '$.custom_fields[?(@.label=="API Key")].value'

The query syntax is very flexible and can be used to search the JSON object
for any type of desired response. Note that when typing custom field values in
your request, make sure to escape '\' and '=' characters with a '\' character.

**Example 5:** Retrieving raw JSON for the individual secret

Copy

    
    
    $ ksm secret get --unmask --uid 8f8I-OqPV58o2r91wVgZ_A --json
    {
        "uid": "8f8I-OqPV58o2r91wVgZ_A",
        "title": "Production MySQL Database",
        "type": "databaseCredentials",
        "fields": [
            {
                "type": "text",
                "value": [
                    "MySQL"
                ]
            },
            {
                "type": "host",
                "value": [
                    {
                        "hostName": "192.168.1.24",
                        "port": "3306"
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "type": "login",
                "value": [
                    "user"
                ]
            },
            {
                "type": "password",
                "value": [
                    "ksv#$0sbnb7W@b3VGCHb"
                ]
            },
            {
                "type": "fileRef",
                "value": []

        ],
        "custom_fields": [],
        "files": []
    }

###

add

Add a record to the vault. There is four ways to add a secret record: clone
existing record, use visual editor, from a file, and from field arguments.

The output of a successful record addition is the record UID(s) via standard
out. There may be additional text, which is in standard error.

####

Editor

The editor command will launch an editor application with a record with
placeholder values. Replace the placeholder values or remove the value all
together. The editor application can be set via [`ksm config
editor`](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/secrets-manager-command-line-
interface/config-command) or it will use the editor specified by the
**EDITOR** environment variable. If the editor is not set, the CLI will
attempt to find an installed editor.

An editor with a UI can be set. For Windows and MacOS blocking may need to be
enabled if the the editor instantly warns about placeholder still existing in
the record template. This is because, without blocking, the CLI will attempt
to process the record before you are finished editing.

On MacOS, blocking will wait until the application fully exits before
processing the record data. This mean the application is closed and no longer
in the dock, not that the editor window is closed.

On Windows, blocking will wait until the process is no longer in the task
list. If the application is launched via a .bat or .cmd file, the process name
will be different from the application that was launch. To properly handle
this use [`ksm config editor`](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/secrets-manager-
command-line-interface/config-command) to set up the editor.

If the editor doesn't block, and a message about template markers is shown,
the file can be rechecked by entering **r**. This can be done when the edit of
the record has been finished and saved.

`ksm secret add editor --sf <STORAGE FOLDER UID> --rt <RECORD TYPE> [--title "TITLE"] [--notes "NOTES"] [-p] [-o yaml | json]`

Required parameters:

`--storage-folder-uid, --sf` The storage folder UID where the new secret
record will be created.

`--record-type, --rt` The record type of the secret record.

Optional parameters:

`--title, -t` Title of the secret record.

`--notes, -n` Notes associated with the secret record.

`--password-generate, -p` Generate a password for any password field that does
not have a value.

`--output-format, -o` The output format of the template in the editor. Can
either be JSON or YAML. The default is JSON.

`--editor, -e` Override the editor. If using this parameter, the editor should
cause blocking.

**Example:**

Launch an editor with a login record with placeholder values. Either set the
value or replace the value altogther, save file and exist browser.

Copy

    
    
    ksm secret add editor --sf XXXXXX --rt login -o yaml
    <in the editor>
    version: v3
    kind: KeeperRecord
    data:
    - recordType: login
      title: '<#ADD: The title of record here. This is required.>'
      notes: '<#ADD: Add some notes or remove.>'
    ...
    <save and exit from editor>
    The following is the new record UID ...
    ["Ai9iFYWf6EOE0T9fV-ynBg"]

You can remove the entire "value" key/value line if there is no value. You do
not need to remove the field.

####

File

The file command is similar to editor command except done in two steps. The
first step is getting a placeholder record file using the command ksm secret
template. Then replacing the placeholder values and using this command to read
in that file to create the record(s).

Using this command allows you create multiple records at one time.

`ksm secret add file --sf <STORAGE FOLDER UID> -f <TEMPLATE FILE> [-p]`

Required parameters:

`--storage-folder-uid, --sf` The storage folder UID where the new secret
record will be created.

`--file, -f` Path and name of the record template file.

Optional parameters:

`--password-generate, -p` Generate a password for any password field that does
not have a value.

**Example:**

Save a bank account record type with placeholder values. Edit in your favorite
editor and save. Then add using the `ksm secret add file` command. Also
generate a password in any blank password fields.

Copy

    
    
    ksm secret template bankAccount -f new_bank_account_record.json
    <edit new_bank_account_record.json in favortite editor>
    ksm secret add file --sf XXXX -f new_bank_account_record.json -p

####

Field

The field command set the values of a record via key/value arguments passed
into the command.

`ksm secret add field <--sf STORAGE FOLDER UID> <--rt RECORD TYPE> <--title
"TITLE>"> [--notes "<NOTES>"] [-p] <"FIELDS" ...>`

Required parameters:

`--storage-folder-uid, --sf` The storage folder UID where the new secret
record will be created.

`--record-type, --rt` The record type of the secret record.

`--title, -t` Title of the secret record.

`FIELDS` \- Key/Value pairs of the fields and their values. There can be
multiple fields.

Optional parameters:

`--notes, -n` Notes associated with the secret record.

`--password-generate, -p` Generate a password for any password field that does
not have a value.

**Example:**

Copy

    
    
    ksm secret add field --sf XXXX --rt bankAccount \
        -t "My Bank Account" -n "My Checking Account" -p \
        "f.bankAccount.accountType=Checking" \
        "f.bankAccount.routingNumber=ROUT123" \
        "f.bankAccount.accountNumber=ACC456" \
        'f.name={"first": "John", "last": "Smith"}' \
        "login=jsmith" \
        "url=http://mybank.com" \
        "c.text[Bank Hours]=7:00AM to 5:00PM" \
        'c.phone=[{"number": "5551234567", "type": "Home"}, {"number": "5550987654"}]'
        
    The following is the new record UID ...
    Ai9iFYWf6EOE0T9fV-ynBg

The structure of the `field` is [`field section .`]<`field type`>[`[field
label]`][`. value key`]<`=value`>

The `field section` is where the field is to be set. '**f** ' is the standard
fields, '**c** ' is the custom fields. If not included, the field default to
the standard fields.

The `field type` is required. For the standard field section, the field type
must be part of the record type schema. If you attempt to add a field that
doesn't exist, an error with be displayed. For the custom field section, any
field type can be added. They will be ordered as they are added.

The `field label` is optional. The field label is surrounded by `[] `directly
after the `field type`. For the custom field section, if the label is not set,
the record field type is used in the UI.

The `value key` is optional for field types that have complex value, such a
`phone`, `bankAccount`, and `name`. The `value key` allows a value to be built
in pieces instead of setting the value as a JSON value.

The `value` begins after the = character. If the value is complex, then JSON
is set as the value. If using JSON make sure the quote the field
appropriately. If the JSON uses double quotes, then surround the field with
single quotes. And if you need both, then you will need to escape the quotes
with a backslash (\\).

**Rules**

For standard fields, the order in which the fields are set does not matter.
The fields will be ordered by the record type schema. Fields that do not
exists in the record type schema standard fields cannot be added to the
standard fields.

For custom field, the fields will be ordered the same as the order of the
field arguments.

If you have multiple fields of the same type you will need to include a `field
label` to make them unique.

_Value Key_

Setting values using value key is useful when setting one field, however there
are rules when setting another field of the same type or when the field
accepts multiple values (ie phone).

If you are setting more than one field of the same type, the use a `field
label` will make the field unique.

Copy

    
    
    ksm secret add field --sf XXXX --rt "Custom Record" \
        "name[My Doctor].first=Jane" \
        "name[My Doctor].last=Smith" \
        "name[My Lawyer].first=John" \
        "name[My Lawyer].last=Doe"

If a `field label` is not used, the prior values will overwrite the existing
values.

_JSON Values_

A value can be set to a JSON value. For fields that allow multiple values,
setting a JSON value will be consider a complete value. That means if a `value
key` comes after a JSON value, an additional value will be added to the field.
The example below will create a phone field with two values.

Copy

    
    
    ksm secret add field --sf XXXX --rt "Custom Record" \
        'c.phone={"number": "5551234567"}' \
        "c.phone.number=5551111111"

If the JSON value is an array of JSON objects. the field is considered a
completed field. This mean no additional values can be added the field. The
following will result in an error about the fields last field not being
unique. To make the field unique a `field label` can be added.

Copy

    
    
    ksm secret add field --sf XXXX --rt "Custom Record" \
        'c.phone=[{"number": "5551234567"}, {"number": "55599999999"}]',
        "c.phone.number=5551111111"
    ksm had a problem: Cannot add this field due to it not being unique. To make unique add a label to the field or make sure the label is not being duplicated.

###

**delete**

`ksm secret delete`

  * `--uid <RECORD UID(s)>` delete records by Record UID

optional parameters:

  * `--json` return in JSON format

an option to set a new title.

`ksm secret add clone --uid <RECORD UID> --title "TITLE"`

Required parameters:

`--uid, -u` The record UID of existing record.

Optional parameters:

`--title, -t` Title of the new record.

**Example:**

Copy

    
    
    ksm secret add clone --uid XXXX --title NewTitle
        
    The following is the new record UID ...
    Ai9iFYWf6EOE0T9fV-ynBg

###

**update**

Update an existing field within an existing secret.

Some field types are complex. This means the value contains arrays and/or
dictionaries for the value. If you are using a field type that is complex, you
will need to use the` --field-json` and `--custom-field-json` to set the
values. The JSON structures can be found
[here](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/commander-cli/using-
commander/default-record-types).

`ksm secret update --uid <RECORD UID>`

Optional Parameters:

  * `--field` \- Update the value of a specific standard field in the secret.

  * `--custom-field` \- Update the value of a specific custom field in the secret. 

  * `--field-json` \- Update the value of a specific standard field using JSON. Use for complex field values.

  * `--custom-field-json` \- Update the value of a specific custom field using JSON. Use for complex field values.

  * `--title, -t` \- Update the title of the secret.

  * `--notes, -n` \- Update the notes of the secret. 

The update will match your key on existing field and custom field labels.
Anything that appears after the '=' character is assumed to be the value. No
escaping values is required, unless you are wrapping the parameter value is
quotes.

**Example 1:** Basic use case

Copy

    
    
    # Update the password for a secret
    $ ksm secret update --uid XXXXX --field password=xxxxxxxxxxx
    
    # Update a custom field value
    $ ksm secret update --uid XXXXX --custom-field "My Custom Label=XXXXX"

**Example 2:** If a key or field values contains a space, the entire parameter
value needs to be wrapped in quotes. If your value contains quotes you need
differnet quotes around the parameter value. For example, if your value
contains JSON, use single quotes around the parameter value.

Copy

    
    
    $ ksm secret update --uid XXXXX --custom-field "My Base64=SElUSEVSRQo="
    
    $ ksm secret update --uid XXXXX --field-json 'name={"first": "John", "middle": "X", "last": "Doe"}'

For more details about environmental variable substitution, see the [Exec
Command](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/secrets-manager-command-line-
interface/exec-command).

If your Record UID start with a dash ("-"), add "--" before the UID to get the
field with notation `ksm secret notation -- <RECORD UID>/field/password`

--uc <# OF UPPCASE CHARS> -d <# OF DIGITS> --sc <# OF SPECIAL CHARACTERS>`

Optional parameters:

Either use `--length` or the character group counts (`--lc`, `--uc`,
`--digits`, `--sc`). If using the character group counts params, the length
will be the total of their values.

Overall length. Character group values will automatically be split equally
from the length.

  * `--length, -l` = Length of password. This will split the length between lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters.

Character groups

  * `-lc` = Number of lowercase characters.

  * `-uc` = Number of uppercase characters.

  * `-d` = Number of digits

  * `-sc` = Number of special characters.

Example:

Copy

    
    
    $ ksm secret password
    j.th,D,X92[B;d<F{2IkxuWS={#G4g7=b39kA16v6p44lqBU=v.Y6?MH5}$H3pG4

###

Record UIDs Starting With "-"

If a record UID starts with "-" (dash / hyphen) it needs to be pre-pended with
"--" to be used with the KSM CLI.

Example:

`ksm secret get -- -id8QpE2ZAkdd4KlCfoWQ`

 _*The UID in this example is not a real record UID_
