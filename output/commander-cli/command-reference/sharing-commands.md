Command

Explanation

Grant or revoke user access to a record

Change shared folder permissions

Change record permissions of a folder

Manage one-time shares

Display or revoke shares to external users

###

share-record command

**Command:**`share-record` or `sr`

**Detail:** Grant or revoke user access to record(s) given that record or
folder path or UID

**Parameters:**

Path or UID of record or folder

**Switches:**

-e, --email <EMAIL> email of account to edit permissions for (required)

-a, --action <{_grant, revoke, owner, cancel_}> permission to set for record

-s, --share allow user to share record

-w, --write allow user to modify record

-R, --recursive apply command to shared folder hierarchy

\--dry-run display the permissions changes without committing them

\--expire-at EXPIRE_AT share expiration: "never" or ISO date-time (yyyy-MM-dd[
hh:mm:ss])

\--expire-in <NUMBER>[(mi)nutes|(h)ours|(d)ays|(mo)nths|(y)ears] share
expiration: "never" or period

\--contacts-only share only to known targets. Allows routing to alternate
domains with matching usernames if needed

-f, --force skip confirmation prompts

**Examples:**

Copy

    
    
    share-record memberships/Gym -e john.smith@gmail.com
    sr g6rvo2-Uv-BC16ZM33CF3w -e john.smith@gmail.com --share
    sr social/Twitter -e john.smith@gmail.com --action owner
    sr --recursive -e john.smith@gmail.com "My Shared Folder" 
    sr --expire-at "2050-01-01 00:00:01" -e john.smith@gmail.com memberships/Gym
    sr --expire-in 3d -e john.smith@gmail.com social/Twitter
    sr --contacts-only -e bob.dobb@wrongdomain.com 'Wifi Credentials'

  1. Share the "Gym" record in the "memberships" folder with user John Smith

  2. Share a record with the given UID with user John Smith and allow him to share the record with others

  3. Transfer record ownership of the "Twitter" records from the "social" folder with user John Smith

  4. Share all records found in shared-folder "My Shared Folder" (including any in its subfolders) with user John Smith

  5. Share record "Gym" in the "memberships" folder with user John Smith, accessible until 1 second after the start of the year 2050 (GMT) 

  6. Give user John Smith time-limited read-only access (valid only for the next 3 days) to the "Twitter" record in the folder named "social"

  7. Share record 'Wifi Credentials' with the specified user, but only after checking the share recipient against known share targets and substituting — if appropriate — a corresponding _known_ username (w/ a different domain) for those w/ no known exact match. In this example, if _**bob.dobb@rightdomain.com**_ is a known share target but the provided username is not, the calling user would be prompted to confirm before substituting the former for the latter when creating the sharing relationship. Hint: you can skip the confirmation prompt by including the `--force`option.

###

share-folder command

**Command:**`share-folder` or `sf`

**Detail:** Grant or revoke user default permissions for a given (set of)
shared folder(s)

**Parameters:**

Path(s) or UID(s) of folder(s)

**Switches:**

-a, --action <{_grant, revoke, remove_}> permission to set for folder(s) / record(s)

-e, --email <EMAIL, TEAM, *>

  * email - user's email to set folder permissions for

  * team - name of a team to set folder permissions for

  * * - apply relevant permissions for each new user with whom the folder(s) is/are shared

  * @currrent/@existing - apply to all users with existing access to folder(s) 

-r, --record <{RECORD NAME, UID, *, @existing, @current}>

  * record name / UID - specific record to set permissions for

  * * - set default permissions for any new record added to the relevant folder(s)

  * @existing/@current - apply permissions to all records currently contained by the specified shared folder(s)

-p, --manage-records allow managing records. Users/teams only

-o, --manage-users allow managing users. Users/teams only

-s, --can-share allow sharing records. Records only

-d, --can-edit allow modifying records in the folder. Records only

-f, --force apply permissions changes ignoring default folder permissions

\--expire-at TIMESTAMP share expiration: "never" or ISO date-time (yyyy-MM-dd[
hh:mm:ss])

\--expire-in PERIOD share expiration: "never" or period
(<NUMBER>[(y)ears|(mo)nths|(d)ays|(h)ours(mi)nutes])

Shared folder permissions are _additive._ If the default folder permissions
allow a permission, all users and teams that folder is shared with will have
that permission unless it is specifically revoked using `-a revoke`

**Examples:**

Copy

    
    
    share-folder memberships -e Jane.Smith@gmail.com -p 
    sf memberships -r memberships/gym -a revoke --can-share
    sf jdrkYEaf03bG0ShCGlnKww -e DB_ADMINS -p
    sf "Team Passwords" -e "Marketing Team" -a grant -o
    sf * -e DB_ADMINS -p
    sf -a remove -e Jane.Smith@gmail.com memberships
    sf -e Jane.Smith@gmail.com --expire-in 5h memberships

  1. Share the "memberships" shared folder with user Jane.Smith@gmail.com. Allow the user to manage records

  2. Revoke "Can Share" permission from the "gym" record in the "memberships" shared folder

  3. Share the folder with the given UID with the "DB_ADMINS" team and allow them to manage records in the shared folder

  4. Share a "Team Passwords" folder with a team called "Marketing Team" and give permission to manage users

  5. Share all shared folders with the "DB_ADMINS" team and allow them to manage records in the shared folder 

  6. Remove all access to "memberships" shared folder for user _**Jane.Smith@gmail**_

  7. Grant user read-only access to "memberships" shared-folder, valid only for the next 5 hours

####

Changing Default Folder Settings

The Default Folder Settings control the permissions on newly added users and
records. To change the default permissions with the `share-folder` command,
use the [*] symbol.

For example, to set user defaults to "Can Manage Users & Records" and to set
record defaults to "Can Edit & Share" on the Shared Folder based on a UID:

Copy

    
    
    sf --action=grant --email=* --manage-user --manage-records jdrkYEaf03bG0ShCGlnKww
    sf --action=grant --record=* --can-share --can-edit jdrkYEaf03bG0ShCGlnKww

Hint: You can also apply the same permissions used to set a shared folder's
default settings (as in the examples above) to records/users currently
assigned to that shared folder within the same command call by simply
specifying the value "@current" or "@existing" for the appropriate option/s
(-r for records, -e for users). Using examples similar to the ones above, we
have the following:

`sf -e * --manage-user --manage-records` -e `@existing`
`jdrkYEaf03bG0ShCGlnKww`

`sf -r * -r @existing --can-share --can-edit -e @existing
jdrkYEaf03bG0ShCGlnKww`

In the 1st example, we set both the default user permissions and the
permissions granted to current users assigned to the shared folder to "can
manage users" and "can manage records".

In the 2nd example, we set both default record permissions and permissions for
already-existing records currently contained by the shared-folder to "can
edit" and "can share' for users that currently have access to that shared-
folder

###

record-permission command

**Detail:** Change the permissions for all records in a shared folder

**Parameters:**

Path or UID of folder

**Switches:**

-a, --action <{_grant, revoke_}> permission access to set for record

-s, --can-share allow sharing records

-d, --can-edit allow modifying records in the folder

-f, --force apply permissions changes without prompting 

-R, --recursive apply permission changes to all sub folders 

\--dry-run Display permission changes made by command without actually
changing the permissions

\--share-record change a record's sharing permissions

\--share-folder change a folder's sharing permissions

**Examples:**

Copy

    
    
    record-permission memberships --action grant --can-share
    record-permission jdrkYEaf03bG0ShCGlnKww -a revoke -d -R
    record-permission social -a grant -s --dry-run

  1. Grant sharing permission to all records in the "memberships" shared folder

  2. Revoke edit permission from all records in the folder with the given UID and all sub folders

  3. See the changes that would be made by granting sharing permissions to the "social" folder but don't apply the permission change

###

###

external-shares-report command

**Command:**`external-shares-report` or `esr`

**Details:** Display and (optionally) revoke share-permissions granted to
users outside of the enterprise

**Switches:**

\--format <{table, json, csv}> format the output, default is 'table'

\--output <FILENAME> output to a filename. Ignored with 'table' format

\--action, -a <{remove, none}> action to perform on external shares, 'none' if
omitted

\--share-type, -t <{direct, shared-folder, all}> filter report by share type,
'all' if omitted

\--force, -f, skip confirmation when removing shares

\--refresh-data, -r refresh local user and record data before running

**Examples:**

Copy

    
    
    external-shares-report
    external-shares-report -r
    esr --output external_shares.json --format json
    external-shares-report -a remove
    esr -a remove -f
    external-shares-report --share-type shared-folder

  1. Show records and shared-folders shared to users outside of the enterprise

  2. Refresh locally-cached enterprise record/folder/user data prior to running and showing report

  3. Run report and export results to a JSON-formatted file named _**external_shares.json**_

  4. Run report, show results, and revoke external shares identified in the results 

  5. Same as #4 above but requires no additional user-interaction to complete execution (i.e., skips confirmation prompt prior to revoking the external shares identified in the report)

  6. Run and show report, limiting results to records shared via direct-share (i.e., omit shared-folders from report)

By default, using the above command to revoke share-permissions previously
granted to external accounts (via `esr -a remove`) requires user-interaction
-- via a confirmation prompt -- to complete.

**Hint** : If you need to perform this task in a non-interactive manner (e.g.,
if running from a Keeper script/batch file, or as part of an automated
administrative tool), include the `--force` flag in your command call (e.g.,
`external-shares-report --force --action remove`)

###

Bulk Record Permission Changes

In this example, we will recursively change the record permissions in a Shared
Folder.

####

1\. Identify Shared Folder UID

On Commander, you can use the "ls -l" command, similar to a Bash shell.

On the Vault user interface, you can click on the info dialog to get the
Shared Folder UID.

####

**2\. Validate Record Permissions Change with Commander**

With Commander, execute the `record-permission` command with the `--dry-run`
option to simulate the command. In this example, the Shared Folder UID is
"-FHdesR_GSERHUwBg4vTXw". The command is below: **record-permission --dry-run
--recursive --action grant --can-edit -- -FHdesR_GSERHUwBg4vTXw**

Since the Shared Folder UID beings with '-' in this example, '--' must be
added before the identifier

Running this command produces the following output:

The "SKIP" section is saying that the current user on Commander cannot make
those requested changes, because we are not the owner of the record. The
"GRANT" section indicates the changes that will be allowed.

####

**3\. Execute Permissions Change Command with Commander**

To execute the command, we remove the "--dry-run" portion:

Now, on the Vault UI, the permission of those affected records has been
changed to "Can Edit".

####

Shared Folders With Multiple Record Owners

If you are in a situation with many record owners in the same shared folder
that require update, each of those users can simply run the above Commander
action to change the permissions of their respective records.

Hint:

If you are an enterprise-user with share-admin privileges, you need only
perform the steps outlined above once to change permissions for all records
(regardless of who owns those records) in the shared-folder.

In such a case, there is no need for other record-owners to repeat the same
steps, thus greatly simplifying the process.

###

Bulk Record-Ownership Transfer

Using steps _almost_ identical to those of the previous example (in which we
show how to change permissions for all records within a shared folder), it is
also possible to transfer ownership of all records within a given shared
folder to a single account.

For the following example (using the same vault and shared folder as the
previous example), let's assume that we would like to transfer ownership of
the records in that shared folder to user _**joe.smith@gmail.com**_. The steps
are as follows:

####

1\. Identify Shared Folder UID

####

**2\. Validate Record-Ownership Transfer Command with Commander**

Similar to the previous example, we can simulate the desired action prior to
its actual execution by running the `share-record` command with the `--dry-
run` option in Commander (Note: unlike the previous example, we will also need
to specify the username -- _**john.smith@gmail.com**_ in this example -- for
the account to which ownership of records should be transferred). The command
is as follows:

`**share-record --action owner --email john.smith@gmail.com --dry-run
--recursive -- -FHdesR_GSERHUwBg4vTXw**`

####

**3\. Execute Record-Ownership Transfer Command with Commander**

Finally, as in the previous example, we remove the `--dry-run` option from our
command call to perform the desired action, like so:

`**share-record --action owner --email john.smith@gmail.com --recursive --
-FHdesR_GSERHUwBg4vTXw**`
