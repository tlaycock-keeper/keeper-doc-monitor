Overview

Within the Vault and via the commander CLI, it's possible to create records of
a specific type. And if this capability is enabled by your Keeper
Administrator, you can even create custom record type templates. Record Types
define the fields available to a record. They act as a record blueprint, which
makes it easy to create and manage records for a variety of different uses.

There is a set of  defined by Keeper, these include common types like Login,
Passport, and SSH Keys.

It is also possible to to be used by your organization.
