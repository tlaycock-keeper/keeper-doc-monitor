Commander **CSV Record Import**

Keeper Commander supports .csv text file import using comma separated values.
CSV import files can contain data for certain fields, folders, subfolders,
shared folders and default shared folder permissions.

Use this order of fields shown below with commas separating each value (and no
spaces around the commas). Not all fields are required; some can be left
blank.

Custom fields begin with the name in the 8th field, (column H). The custom
field value goes in the next field (column I).

  * To specify subfolders, use backslash "\" between folder names

  * To set shared folder permission on the record, use the #edit or #reshare tags as seen below

  * Enclose fields in quotes for multi-line or special characters

  * Ensure files are UTF-8 encoded for support of international or double-byte characters

Below is an example csv file that showcases several import features including
personal folders, shared folders, subfolders, special characters and multi-
line fields.
