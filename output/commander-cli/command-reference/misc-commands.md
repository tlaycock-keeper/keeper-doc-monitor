###

security-audit sync command

**Command:**`security-audit sync` or `sas`

This command is available only to enterprise administrators

**Detail:** Sync security audit data for enterprise vault(s). Used to correct
mis-matching summary security audit scores as seen by the user (in their
vault) and by an enterprise administrator (either in the admin console app or
via a call to `security-audit-report` in Commander)

**Parameters:**

Username(s) of vault(s) whose security data are to be synced. Multiple values
allowed. Specify`@all` to perform sync for all enterprise vaults.

**Switches:**

`--soft `Do a "soft" sync of security data. Does not require corresponding
vault login. This is the default sync-type.

`--medium `Do a "medium" sync of security data. Can sync some data without the
corresponding vault login.

`--hard `Do a "hard" sync of security data. No data are synced until the
corresponding vault login occurs.

`-f` or `--force` Perform sync without being prompted for confirmation (non-
interactive mode)

`-v` or `--verbose` Output a Security Audit report after performing sync

**Examples:**

Copy

    
    
    security-audit sync user1@domain.com
    security-audit sync --hard user2@domain.com user3@domain.com
    sas --hard @all
    sas --verbose --hard user1@domain.com

  1. Perform a "soft" sync of security data for vault owned by _user1@domain.com_

  2. Initiate a "hard" security-data sync for the vaults belonging to _user2@domain.com_ and _user3@domain.com_

  3. Initiate a "hard" security-data sync for all vaults in the enterprise

  4. Perform a "hard" sync of security-audit data for _user1@domain.com_ and run a Security Audit report immediately after. Note that, in this scenario, you should expect the resulting report to show all 0s in the affected vault's summary scores (to be updated eventually once the affected owner logs in to their vault).

Hint: If the total password record count shown in a user's vault (in "Security
Audit" view) differs from the corresponding value shown in the admin console
(also in "Security Audit" view) or the output of Commander's `security-audit-
report --show-updated` command, use the `--hard` flag to force a summary
security audit score reset/re-calculation to re-align those values.

###

please refer to the [`run-batch`](/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/command-
reference/misc-commands#run-batch-command) command.
