####

**Custom Emails**

The `--invite-email` switch allows you to set the custom email template per
node.

Similar to how email templates can be customized on the web admin console,
custom email templates on the CLI supports customization of the following four
attributes:

  * Subject

  * Message Heading

  * Message Body

  * Download Button Text

Custom email templates can be defined in a `.txt` file in the following
format:

Copy

    
    
    [Subject]
    // Insert E-mail Subject line text
    
    [Heading]
    // Insert E-mail Message heading text here
    
    [Message]
    // Insert E-mail Message body text here
    
    [Button Text]
    // Insert the download button text here 

####

**Custom Email Use Case**

Suppose there are company branches in Chicago and Tokyo with its respective
nodes `Chicago` and `Tokyo`. Ideally, you want the invitation emails to be in
its native language:

  * Invitation emails sent to the Chicago Branch should be in its native language English

  * Invitation emails sent to the Tokyo Branch should be in its native language Japanese 

The `--invite-email` __ switch makes this possible by enabling you to set the
desired email template per node.

First, I define the custom email templates for both of my branches: `Chicago`
and `Tokyo`

Next, I set the appropriate email template for each node:

Copy

    
    
    en Chicago --invite-email="C:\user\emailTemplates\emailChicago.txt"
    en Tokyo --invite-email="C:\user\emailTemplates\emailTokyo.txt"

On windows, file paths can be specified either in quotations or double
backslash. Either of the following file paths are valid:

`"C:\users\file.txt"` or `c:\\users\\file.txt`

When sending invitation emails, users will receive the following emails based
on their branch location:

###

enterprise-push command

**Detail:** Populate a vault with a set of default records

**Parameters:**

File name of file with template records. File must be JSON format.

**Switches:**

`--syntax-help` show example file format and template parameters

`--team` <TEAM NAME OR UID> team to assign records to

`--email` <USER EMAIL OR UID> user to assign records to

**Examples:**

Copy

    
    
    enterprise-push office-codes.json --team "Chicago Office"
    enterprise-push default.json --email Jane.Doe@gmail.com
    enterprise=push --syntax-help

  1. Send records templated in the "office-codes.json" file to every user in the "Chicago Office" team

  2. Send records templated in the "default.json" file to user "Jane.Doe@gmail.com"

  3. See the syntax help

**File Format**

The "enterprise-push" command uses Keeper JSON record import format.

Example JSON file:

Copy

    
    
    [
        {
            "title": "Google",
            "login": "${user_email}",
            "password": "${generate_password}",
            "login_url": "https://google.com",
            "notes": "",
            "custom_fields": {
                "Name 1": "Value 1",
                "Name 2": "Value 2"
            }
        },
        {
            "title": "Admin Tool",
            "login": "${user_email}",
            "password": "",
            "login_url": "https://192.168.1.1",
            "notes": "",
            "custom_fields": {
            }
        }
    ]

Supported template parameters:

Copy

    
    
    ${user_email}          User email address
    ${generate_password}   Generate random password
    ${user_name}           User full name

An easy way to find the proper JSON structure is to export some data from your
Keeper vault in JSON format. Then, modify the file as required for creating an
import file.

To export JSON data for creating a template:

  * Create an empty folder for storing templates. e.g. "Templates"

  * Create records in that folder

  * `export` the folder as JSON using the below command

Copy

    
    
    export --format=json --folder=Templates templates.json

  * Optional: edit the JSON file to delete the following properties: "uid", "schema", "folders" not used by `enterprise-push` command

The template JSON file should be either array of records or an object that
contains a property "records" containing an array of records.
