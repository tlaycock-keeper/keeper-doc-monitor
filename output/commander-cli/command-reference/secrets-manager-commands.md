# Secrets Manager Commands

Commands to configure and manage the Keeper Secrets Manager platform

##

Overview

Keeper Secrets Manager is a cloud-based, Zero-Knowledge platform for DevOps
and engineering teams to centrally manage and control access to privileged
accounts. Common use cases for Secrets Manager include:

  * Removing hard-coded credentials from source code, configuration files and CI/CD systems

  * Protecting access to privileged passwords, API keys and other managed secrets.

  * Providing vault access to machines and applications.

  * Rotating service account credentials on-demand or on a schedule

In Keeper Secrets Manager, an "Application" is created for every target
environment which needs access to specific folders in the Keeper Vault. An
Application can be granted access to one ore more Shared Folders or records
within the vault. An Application can be utilized by one or more "Clients"
which are individually authenticated and managed by the Secrets Manager
infrastructure.

As an example, a Keeper "Application" might represent a production system, and
each individual web server in your production system would represent a Client.
Each Client authenticates and communicates to the Keeper Vault using a Client
ID and a Private Key which is used to sign the request.

The commands in this document can be used to configure the Keeper Secrets
Manager applications and client devices.

###

Keeper Secrets Manager Commands

Whether using the interactive shell, CLI or JSON config file, Keeper supports
the following commands, each command supports additional parameters and
options.

To get help on a particular command, run:

`help <command>`

**secrets-manager Command Format**

Keeper Secrets Manager commands follow the format:

`secrets-manager <command> <sub command>`

For example to list all apps use the following command:

`secrets-manager app list`

A list of all secrets-manager commands and details about each are below:

Secrets Manager CLI Command

Description

`secrets-manager app list`

List all Secrets Manager applications to view the App UID, last access and
number of records/folders assigned.

`secrets-manager app get`

Retrieve detailed information about the application including devices

`secrets-manager app create`

Create a new application

`secrets-manager app remove`

Delete an application

`secrets-manager app share`

Share an application and associated gateways and configurations with another
user.

`secrets-manager app unshare`

Unshare an application from a user

`secrets-manager client add`

Create a device or machine identity associated with an application

`secrets-manager client remove`

Remove a device

`secrets-manager share add`

Associate a folder or record with an application

`secrets-manager share remove`

Remove a folder or record from an application

###

Example API Flow

Below is an example of creating an application, assigning secrets and creating
machine devices.

###

Create an application

`secrets-manager app create <APPLICATION NAME>`

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> secrets-manager app create MyApplication

###

Create a New Secret

This can be done on the Vault user interface, but we'll create a Secret,
create a Shared Folder, then move the Secret into the Shared Folder. Example
commands are below:

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> add --login admin --pass "46$$625" --url "192.168.1.1" -t "Test Secret"
    My Vault> mkdir -sf -a "My Shared Folder"
    My Vault> mv "Test Secret" "My Shared Folder"

###

Share the Folder to the Secrets Manager Application

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> secrets-manager share add --app MyApplication --secret n4QtaKjRjhWMz5aS7bT77Q

To find the Shared Folder or Record UID, use the 'ls -l' command or Vault user
interface in the "info" dialog.

###

Allow a client to access an application

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> secrets-manager client add MyApplication

The output of this command provides the One Time Access Token that will be
used on the client.

###

Get a List of all applications

`secrets-manager app list`

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> secrets-manager app list
    
    List of all Applications

`secrets-manager app get <APPLICATION NAME|APP UID>`

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> secrets-manager app get MyApplication
