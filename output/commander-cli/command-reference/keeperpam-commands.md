Overview

KeeperPAM including discovery, password rotation, PAM Configuration and Keeper
Gateway configuration can be controlled and managed through Commander using
the `pam` command and sub-commands. These commands support the  and
capabilities of Keeper Secrets Manager and KeeperPAM.

##

pam**command**

**command:**`pam`

**Detail:** Perform KeeperPAM controls.

Copy

    My Vault> pam gateway help
    pam command [--options]
    
    Command    Description
    ---------  ------------------
    list       List Gateways
    new        Create new Gateway
    remove     Remove Gateway

###

**Sub-Command: config**

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> pam config help

    remove     Remove a PAM Configuration

###

Sub-Command: connection

**Prerequisites:** Ensure that the PAM user credential, PAM Machine or PAM
Database records are staged in a shared folder - that there is a gateway
configured, and everything is tied together in a PAM Configuration. This
command will edit KCM connection parameters and user accounts that are
attached to PAM Machine and PAM Database records. The process can be done in
bulk with the **run-batch** command.

Example - Set the password complexity for the PAM User

The `--complexity` or `-x` params are used to set the password complexity.

Set the password complexity to create a 20 character password with a minimum
of 1 uppercase letter, 4 lowercase letters, 2 digits, and 2 symbols from the
symbol set `.=+-` .
