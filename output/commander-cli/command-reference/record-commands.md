`--preserve-dir` Preserve vault folder structure

**Naming Convention for downloaded attachments:**

Naming Convention

Description

`$AttachmentFileName `

By default, all downloaded attachments will retain their original name. If a
record contains the attachment "file.txt", the name of the downloaded
attachment will be: `file.txt`

`$AttachmentFileName($RecordUUID).$AttachmentFileNameExtension `

This is the naming convention for duplicates. If a record contains two
attachments with the same name (i.e "file.txt") or the output directory
already contains a file with the same name, the naming convention of the
downloaded attachments will be: `file.txt` and
`file(Lw7K5ah3LjP5uVkhkrSzrw).txt`

`$AttachmentFileName($AttachmentUUID).$AttachmentFileNameExtension `

For duplicates, if the naming convention in the above row is used, then the
`AttachmentUUID` will be used instead of `RecordUUID`. In the given examples
for the row above, downloading file.txt will use the `attachmentUUID` instead
of the `recordUUID`: `file(Bu2WLg-7eqWPhO-NW18lgw).txt`

`$RecordName-$AttachmentFileName`

If the switch `--record-title` is passed, the record name will be appended to
downloaded attachment file. This also applies to duplicates. For a record
named "Record1" with the attachment "file.txt", the naming convention will be:
`Record1-file.txt `

**Examples:**

Copy

    
    
    download-attachment "documents/Financial Records"

Suppose there are multiple shortcuts for the following record, and you only

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> shortcut list 461XtX26R1SggIyQDf4HZg
    Record UID              Record Title    Folder
    ----------------------  --------------  ----------------------
    461XtX26R1SggIyQDf4HZg  ksm-key1        [ User ] /key-folder1/
                                            [ User ] /key-folder2/
                                            [ User ] /key-folder3/

To keep this record only in the "key-folder2" and remove all other shortcuts,
you can execute the following command:

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> shortcut keep 461XtX26R1SggIyQDf4HZg key-folder2

Running the above command will prompt you to confirm the deletion of the extra
shortcuts

To verify that the additional shortcuts have been deleted, you can do one of
the following:

  1. Access your web vault and observe that the shortcuts have been deleted. Example: In the above scenario & example, I will find only one instance of the record `ksm-key1` in `key-folder2`

  2. Running the `shortcut list <Record UID>` command will output that the record has no shortcuts In the above scenario & example, after deleting the unwanted shortcuts, running the `list` command will give me the following:

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> shortcut list 461XtX26R1SggIyQDf4HZg 
    shortcut-get: Record UID 461XtX26R1SggIyQDf4HZg does not have shortcuts
