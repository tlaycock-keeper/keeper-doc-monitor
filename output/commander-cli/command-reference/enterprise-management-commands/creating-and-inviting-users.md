# Creating and Inviting Users

Methods for creating user account with Commander

##

Overview

There are two methods for creating user accounts with Commander:

  * Invite users to an enterprise with the `enterprise-user --add` command

  * Create new user accounts and vaults with the `create-user` command

This page will go over the usage of each method.

###

Which method should I use?

In most cases the best method to use is to invite new users with `enterprise-
user --add` which will send vault creation instructions to new users' email.

`create-user` may be useful in special circumstances where it is necessary for
an administrator to have immediate access to a new vault, or when records need
to be shared to a new vault right away.

Enterprises that require MFA or SSO Login will need to have these credentials
available for each new user if using the `create-user` command.

##

Invite Users to an Enterprise

Use Commander to invite users to an enterprise by their email address.

To invite users to your enterprise using Commander, use the `enterprise-user`
command with the `--add` flag.

####

Format:

Copy

    
    
    enterprise-user John_Smith@example.com --add

The invited user's display name can be pre-set by adding the `--name` flag
followed by the desired name.

The invited user can be automatically put into a designated node with the
`--node` flag followed by the name of a node in the enterprise.

####

Complete Example:

Copy

    
    
    enterprise-user John_Smith@example.com --add --node "Chicago" --name "John Smith"

_Hint:_ You can use the shortened version of the command as well: `eu`

e.g. `eu John_Smith@example.com --add`

 _Find more information in the_[ _command
documentation._](/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/command-reference/enterprise-
management-commands#enterprise-user-command)

###

Invitation Email and Vault Creation

To join the enterprise, the invited user will need to accept an invite emailed
to them.

![](https://docs.keeper.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F762006384-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-

prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-MJXOXEifAmpyvNVL1to%252Fuploads%252F9PQAwVuLYXbONMjioaMg%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D999cd7c4-3b38-4081-9fe3-857919c24c9d&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=a890c97c&sv=2)

User invite email

When the user clicks "Set Up Your Account Now" they are taken to the Keeper
Web Vault to proceed with account creation.

Until the invited user logs into their Vault, their Vault is not setup or
accessible and records cannot be shared with them.

###

Example: Invite Users from Email Addresses in a File

In this example, we will take a file with a list of email addresses and send
an invite to each email address.

####

Setup

  * Update Commander

    * Before getting started, be sure that you have the most up-to-date version of Commander. Find the most recent release on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/Commander/releases).

  * Set Persistent Login

    * Persistent login will allow Commander to run commands without needing you to login between each call. To enable persistent login, run the following commands in Keeper Commander:

Copy

    
    
    this-device register
    this-device persistent-login on

 _For more information on persistent login and options, see the_[
_documentation page_](/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/commander-installation-
setup/logging-in#persistent-login) _._

####

Getting Started

First gather the email addresses into a file. In this example the file will
look like this:

user_emails.txt

Copy

    
    
    john_smith@example.com
    jane_doe@example.com
    mary_sue@example.com
    chris_adams@example.com
    amanda_patel@example.com

For this example, each email address is on its own line. The file can contain
any number of email addresses.

####

Send Invites

Now that the file is ready, we can use a simple script to cycle through each
email and send an invite.

Windows Command PromptLinux / MacOS Terminal

Copy

    
    
    for /f %e in (user_emails.txt) do keeper enterprise-user "%e" --add

Copy

    
    
    while read email; do
       keeper enterprise-user "$email" --add
    done < user_emails.txt

Run the script for your operating system from the examples above to send an
invite to each email address from the file.

####

Advanced Example: Include User's Name and Node

To expand upon the above example, we can include a user's display name and
node in the file then apply these details to the user's account when sending
them an invite.

For this example the file will now look like this:

users.txt

Copy

    
    
    john_smith@example.com,John Smith,Chicago Office
    jane_doe@example.com,Jane Doe,New York Office
    mary_sue@example.com,Mary Sue,Chicago Office
    chris_adams@example.com,Chris Adams,Chicago Office
    amanda_patel@example.com,Amanda Patel,New York Office

Each line now has each user's email address, display name, and node separated
by commas.

The given nodes must match an existing node name in the Keeper Enterprise. The
nodes must exist before sending invites to new users.

To include these details in the invitation command, we simply need to add the
relevant flags to the script.

Windows Command PromptLinux / MacOS Terminal

Copy

    
    
    for /f "tokens=1,2,3 delims=," %e in (users.txt) do keeper eu "%e" --add --name "%f" --node "%g"

Copy

    
    
    while IFS=, read -r email name node; do
       keeper eu "$email" --add --name "$name" --node "$node"
    done < users.txt

Notice that the shortened version of the enterprise-user command eu is used
here

Run the script appropriate for your OS and each user from the file will get an
invite in their email, their display name will be set, and they will be placed
in the correct node.

This example could be altered to only supply the display name or node, or to
perform other tasks like adding a list of users to a specified team or role.

##

Create New User Accounts

Sometimes it is necessary to create a new user account and vault which are
setup and ready to go before the user logs in. To do this, another command can
be used: `create-user`

###

Creating Users with Commander

When the `create-user` command is used Commander will create a new user
account, and set the enterprise data key required for the account to share
records with other accounts in the enterprise. To do this Commander must login
to the new account once when it is created.

####

Format:

Copy

    
    
    create-user John_Smith@example.com --node "Chicago"

When the account is run, you will be prompted to create a password for the new
user. Alternatively you can provide a record from your vault with a password
already set to use as the account's password.

_See more information about this command in the_[ _command
documentation_](/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/command-reference/enterprise-
management-commands#create-user-command)

####

Enterprises with MFA or SSO Login

When using the `create-user` command Commander needs to login to the new
account. This means that if the enterprise requires MFA or SSO Login,
Commander will need the corresponding credentials for the new account in order
to complete vault creation.

It is recommended that enterprises only use `create-user` in special
circumstances, or on initial enterprise creation before MFA or SSO login is
setup and required.

###

Differences with enterprise-user Command

The `create-user` command differs from the `enterprise-user --add` method in
the following ways:

  * `create-user` requires a password for the new account be set by the Commander user

    * (Users invited be `enterprise-user --add` will set their own passwords at account creation)

  * `create-user` requires Commander to login to the new account

  * When creating a user account with `create-user` the vault is created immediately, and can be accessed or have records shared to it right away

`create-user` should only be used in special circumstances or when first
creating a new enterprise.

###

Creating User Accounts From a File

To use the `create-user` command with a list of email addresses from a file,
follow the [steps above](/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/command-
reference/enterprise-management-commands/creating-and-inviting-users#example-
invite-users-from-email-addresses-in-a-file) for the `enterprise-user` command
and swap out that command with `create-user`

For example:

Windows Command PromptLinux / MacOS Terminal

Copy

    
    
    for /f "tokens=1,2,3 delims=," %e in (users.txt) do keeper create-user "%e" --name "%f" --node "%g"

Copy

    
    
    while IFS=, read -r email name node; do
       keeper create-user "$email" --name "$name" --node "$node"
    done < users.txt
