Keeper Commander Service Mode

The Service Mode module for Keeper Commander enables REST API integration by
providing a secure, configurable API server that can be deployed with minimal
setup. This module allows users to execute Commander CLI commands through a
REST API interface while maintaining security and configuration flexibility.
The service can be run locally and it can optionally be integrated with Ngrok
for creating a routable address in your existing Ngrok network.

###

Features

####

Core Functionality

  * **API Server** : Flask-based REST API server for executing Commander CLI commands

  * **Service Management** : Complete lifecycle management for the API service

  * **Configuration Management** : Flexible configuration system with both interactive and streamlined setup options

  * **Security Controls** : Comprehensive security features including API key management, access controls, rate limiting and IP allow/deny.

  * **Flexible Hosting Options** : Run on-prem, Docker container or in the cloud with integrated **Ngrok** agent. 

####

Service Commands

Command

Description

`service-create`

Initialize and configure the service with customizable settings

`service-start`

Start the service with existing configuration

`service-stop`

Gracefully stop the running service

`service-status`

Display current service status

`service-config-add`

Add new API configuration and command access settings

####

Security Features

  * API key authentication

  * Configurable token expiration (minutes/hours/days)

  * Optional AES-256 GCM encryption for API responses

  * TLS with provided certificate

  * Rate limiting

  * IP deny list management

  * Request validation and policy enforcement

###

Security

The Keeper Commander Service Mode feature is a self-hosted middleware that
wraps an existing Commander session with a REST API. This feature is suited to
environments where high speed requests and simple HTTP-based APIs are desired.

To ensure the most secure use of this feature, we recommend the following:

  * Limit the scope of the Command access controls to only those commands which are required based on the use case.

  * Apply IP allowlist for accessing the REST API endpoint

  * Protect access to the machine running the Commander service

  * Use different API tokens for different commands and use cases

###

Usage

####

Basic Setup

Start Keeper Commander:

Copy

    
    
    keeper shell

Log in with your Keeper credentials when prompted

####

Interactive Configuration

Create and configure the service with interactive prompts:

Copy

    
    
    service-create

You'll be prompted to configure:

  * Config format

  * Port number

  * Ngrok auth token (optional)

  * Security settings (optional)

  * Command access controls

Example:

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> service-create
    Enter Port No:9090
    Enable Ngrok Tunneling? (y/n):y
    Enter Ngrok Auth Token:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    Enter Ngrok Custom Domain:myname
    Enable Advanced Security? (y/n):n
    List of supported commands, Enter comma separated:whoami,record-add,tree,ls
    Generated API key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    Uploading service_config.yaml ...
    
    2025-03-26 11:47:46 [INFO] keeper_service - Route initialization completed
    Route initialization completed successfully
    Keeper Commander Service initialization complete
    Commander Service starting on http://localhost:9090
    Process ID: 34291
    Generated ngrok URL: https://myname.ngrok.io
     * Serving Flask app 'keepercommander.service.app'
     * Debug mode: off

####

Streamlined Configuration

Configure the service with a single command:

Copy

    
    
    service-create -p 9090 -c 'record-add,whoami'

Starting the service with Ngrok auth token and custom domain:

Copy

    
    
     service-create -p 9090 -c 'record-add,whoami' -ng xxxx -cd myname

Parameters:

  * `-p, --port`: Port number for the service

  * `-c, --commands`: Comma-separated list of allowed commands

  * `-ng, --ngrok`: Ngrok authentication token for cloud managed URL access (Optional)

  * `-cd`: Ngrok custom domain, just subdomain portion (Optional)

  * `-aip`: allowed IP list (Optional)

  * `-dip`: denied IP list (Optional)

  * `-crtf, --certfile`: SSL certificate file path, accepts `.crt`, `.pem` or `.key` (Optional)

  * `-crtp, --certpassword`: SSL certificate password (Optional)

After the initial configuration, Commander will create a record in the vault
with the title of "Commander Service Mode". This record will contain a YAML
file called `service_config.yaml`.

Subsequent startups of the service simply require the `service-create`
command, with no parameters. The configuration will be loaded from the vault
and started up.

####

Service Management

Check service status:

Copy

    
    
    service-status

Add additional configuration:

Copy

    
    
    service-config-add

Start the service:

Copy

    
    
    service-start

Stop the service:

Copy

    
    
    service-stop

###

API Usage

Using the REST API is very simple and only requires the supplied API key and
Commander command, exactly as you would type it into the CLI.

####

Execute Command Endpoint

Copy

    
    
    curl --location 'http://localhost:<port>/api/v1/executecommand' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
    --data '{
        "command": "tree"
    }'

If you're using Ngrok, the Curl command will be:

Copy

    
    
    curl --location 'http://<your-ngrok-url>/api/v1/executecommand' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
    --data '{
    	"command": "tree"
    }'

####

Postman

You can send requests through the Postman app. Just ensure that the Content-
Type header and api-key header is provided. Example screenshot below:

###

API Response

All responses use this basic format:

Copy

    
    
    { "command": "<command_name>", "data": <command_specific_data> , "status": "success"}

###

Command Specific Responses

Some commands have been modified to return formatted JSON. Other commands will
return data exactly as they normally do through the Commander CLI version.

Examples of modified output:

####

List Command (ls):

{ "status": "success", "command": "ls", "data": { "folders": [ { "number": 1,
"uid": "folder_uid_string", "name": "My Folder", "flags": "RW" } ], "records":
[ { "number": 1, "uid": "record_uid_string", "type": "login", "title": "My
Login", "description": "Optional description" } ] } }

####

Tree Command:

{ "status": "success", "command": "tree", "data": [ { "level": 0, "name":
"Root Folder", "path": "Root Folder" }, { "level": 1, "name": "Subfolder",
"path": "Root Folder/Subfolder" } ] }

####

Make Directory Command (mkdir):

{ "status": "success", "command": "mkdir", "data": { "folder_uid":
"new_folder_uid_string" } }

####

Record Add Command:

{ "status": "success", "command": "record-add", "data": { "record_uid":
"new_record_uid_string" } }

####

Search Record Command:

{ "status": "success", "command": "search record", "data": [ { "number": 1,
"uid": "record_uid_string", "type": "login", "title": "Matching Record",
"description": "Optional description" } ] }

####

Search Folder Command:

{ "status": "success", "command": "search folder", "data": [ { "number": 1,
"uid": "folder_uid_string", "name": "Matching Folder" } ] }

####

Get Command:

{ "command": "get", "data": { "attachments": "service_config.yaml 537b ID:
XYZ", "last_modified": "2025-01-18 15:35:21", "share_admins": "xyz@email.com",
"shared": "False", "shared_users": "xyz@email.com (Owner)", "title":
"Commander Service Mode", "type": "", "uid": "folder_uid_string" }, "status":
"success" }

####

Commands with --format = json enabled (e.g. audit-report --format=json):

{ "status": "success", "command": "audit-report", "data": [ {
"audit_event_type": "open_record", "created": "2025-02-18T10:30:45+00:00",
"geo_location": "New York, NY, US", "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
"keeper_version": "Commander 16.11.0", "message": "User john.doe@example.com
opened record UID ABCD1234EFGH5678", "username": "john.doe@example.com" } ] }

###

Advanced Configuration

####

Ngrok

Using Ngrok has security implications. Follow this guidance:

  * Ensure that the Keeper service account is running with minimal permissions and access. We recommend limiting the scope of the service account to only the least amount of privilege.

  * Protect access to the service through Ngrok's IP policies

  * 

####

Rate Limited Rules

Defines maximum API requests allowed within a specified time frame.

Input Format: `X/[minute|hour|day]` or `X per [minute|hour|day]`

Valid Examples: "`100/minute`", "`50/hour`", "`1000 per day`"

Note: Case insensitive

####

IP Allow and IP Deny

Controls access based on IP addresses or IP network ranges.

Input Format: Comma-separated list of IP addresses or CIDR blocks

Validation Rules: Each IP must be valid IPv4 address or CIDR block

Valid Examples: "`192.168.1.1, 10.0.0.0/24`"

Notes: Empty list is allowed (skips validation)

####

Encryption Settings

Optional layer of AES-256 (GCM) encryption for all REST API responses

Input Format: `y` or `n`

Private Key Validation Rules:

  * Exactly 32 characters long

  * Allowed characters: alphanumeric and special characters (@#$%^&+=)

  * Cannot be empty

Note: The Key is required for API response decryption.

####

Token Expiration

Configures the REST API token lifespan.

Input Format: Xm, Xh, or Xd where X is a positive number and time units
represent m for minutes, h for hours and d for days.

Validation Rules:

  * Value must be a positive number

  * Unit must be one of m, h or d

  * Valid Examples: "`30m`", "`24h`", "`7d`".

Note: Empty input will set the token to never expire.

####

Command List

Specify the list of commands to be exposed via the API

Input Format: Comma-separated list of valid Keeper Commander commands

Validation Rules:

  * Must be a comma-separated list of valid Keeper Commander commands (can be seen by executing help in Commander CLI or entering some wrong command).

  * Cannot be empty

  * No spaces in individual commands.

  * Valid Example: "`whoami,tree,list`"

Input Format: Select between 'json' or 'yaml'

Validation Rules: Must be either 'json' or 'yaml' (case insensitive)

###

Multiple API Token Support

The `service_config.yaml` file stored in the vault contains the service
properties. In the file there is a section called "records". This allows you
to define an API key with specific commands and token expiration.

Copy

    
    
    encryption: ''
    encryption_private_key: ''
    ip_allowed_list: 0.0.0.0/0
    ip_denied_list: ''
    is_advanced_security_enabled: n
    ngrok: y
    ngrok_auth_token: XXXXXXXXXX
    ngrok_custom_domain: myname
    ngrok_public_url: ''
    port: 9090
    rate_limiting: ''
    records:
    - api-key: XXXXXXXX
      command_list: tree,record-add
      expiration_timestamp: '9999-12-31T23:59:59'
    - api-key: XXXXXXXX
      command_list: get
      expiration_timestamp: '9999-12-31T23:59:59'

###

Docker Deploy

####

Install, build and run docker image

  1. Install Docker.

  2.   3. Build docker image using command `docker build -t keeper-commander .`

  4. Verify docker image created. `docker images`

  5. Set two environment variables in your terminal window:

     1. `KEEPER_USERNAME` \- This is the username that will login to Keeper Commander

     2. `KEEPER_PASSWORD` \- This is the master password for the above user

  6. Run the keeper-commander docker image using command

Copy

         
         docker run -d -p <port>:<port> keeper-commander \ 
           service-create -p <port> -c '<comma separated commands like tree,ls>' \
           -ng <ngrok-auth-token> -cd <ngrok-custom-domain> \
           -aip <allowed-ip-list> -dip <denied-ip-list> \
           --user $KEEPER_USERNAME \
           --password $KEEPER_PASSWORD

  7. Verify keeper-commander image is started using command `docker ps`

  8. Check the logs using command

Copy

         
         docker logs <docker container name or ID>

and get the API key from logs. The API key will show up like this:

Copy

         
         Generated API key: <API-KEY>

####

Execute Command Endpoint

Copy

    
    
    curl --location 'http://localhost:<port>/api/v1/executecommand' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
    --data '{
       "command": "<command>"
    }'

###

Background Mode

Keeper Commander supports persistent login mode (e.g. "Stay Logged In"), which
keeps the session active for a specific amount of time. To activate persistent
login mode on an account, type the following:

Copy

    
    
    this-device persistent-login on
    this-device register

If persistent login is enabled, you won't be prompted to authenticate the next
time you run Commander. Persistent login is required to ensure uninterrupted
background execution of the Service Mode APIs, allowing seamless
authentication without repeated login prompts.

###
