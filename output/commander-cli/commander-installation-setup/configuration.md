# Configuration and Usage

Understanding the Commander configuration file for automation and CLI usage

##

Commander Configuration File

When you login to Commander for the first time, a `**config.json**`file is
created, if one does not exist. When launching Commander as an application,
the config file is created at `~/.keeper` on MacOS and Linux, and at
`C:\Users\[USERNAME]\.keeper` on Windows. When using Commander from the
command line or terminal, the `config.json` file is created in the current
directory, unless the `--config` option is passed a different location.

###

**Config File Example**

Copy

    
    
    {
        "server": "keepersecurity.eu",
        "user": "services@company.com",
        "password": "your_password_here",
        "private_key": "yaeK4jMeIGNkSR2pi4xf2XGmYM094YMUoE8-QEW9CAA",
        "device_token": "g6RDMxr1t-bcVdBeBpz-xQ",
        "mfa_duration": "forever",
        "proxy": "http://proxy_user:proxy_password@host:port",
        "sso_master_password": false,
        "skip_records": false,
        "debug": false,
        "plugins": [],
        "commands": [],
        "timedelay": 0
    }

###

Config File Options

  * `server` Keeper data center region

Commander defaults to the US region, so customers hosted in other regions will
need to specify a server in the config.

Region

Property Setting for "server"

US

https://keepersecurity.com

EU

https://keepersecurity.eu

AU

https://keepersecurity.com.au

GOV

https://govcloud.keepersecurity.us

CA

https://keepersecurity.ca

JP

https://keepersecurity.jp

  * `debug` enable or disable detailed crypto output and network logging 

    * set to `true` or `false`

  * `plugins` Set which password rotation plugin will be loaded. 

    * [Learn more](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/Commander/tree/master/keepercommander/plugins) about password rotation plugins for Commander. 

  * `commands` Comma-separated list of Keeper commands to run 

  * `timedelay` Run the specified commands every X seconds. 

    * example: `"timedelay":600` will run the commands every 10 minutes. 

  * `private_key` Device private key generated by Commander on a new device. This key is used to encrypt and decrypt vault data. 

  * `device_token` Device token generated by the backend for every new device. The device token is used to uniquely identify the device, and it controls the session behavior. 

  * `proxy `Proxy URL: `schema://[user:password@]host:port` where schema

    * `http` HTTP proxy

    * `socks5` SOCKS5 proxy with local DNS

    * `socks4` SOCKS4 proxy with local DNS

    * `socks4a` SOCKS4 proxy with remote DNS

    * `socks5h` SOCKS5 proxy with remote DNS 

  * `sso_master_password` Forces master password login for Enterprise SSO Accounts 

  * `skip_records` Prevents syncing of records if the value is set to `true`. For users with very large vaults, this allows you to login and perform commands without requiring a full sync of records. After login, to force sync records use `sync-down --force `Example line in config.json: `"skip_records":true,`

###

Running Commands from the Configuration File

Using the `commands` field allows for predetermined commands to be run on
login.

Enter a comma-separated list of Keeper Commander commands to be run. Example:

Copy

    
    
    config.json
    {
     ...
     "commands": ["sync-down", "file-report -d"]
     ...
    }

In this example, it will sync, and then download a report of the available
files in the vault.

###

Configuration File Location

If you start Commander from the **binary installer** , the config file will be
located in the user's home directory in a folder called "**.keeper** ".

  * On Mac environments, the configuration file is located in `~/.keeper/config.json`

  * In Windows environments, the configuration file is located in `/Users/{Username}/Documents/.keeper/config.json`

If you use Commander from a pip3 or source installation, the configuration
file will be created in the current folder where the Commander executable is
started from.

You can specify the config file to use when launching Commander, for example:

Copy

    
    
    $ keeper shell --config /path/to/config.json

##

Authenticating on Multi-Server Environments

In an environment with multiple servers or dynamic servers, you can use the
same `config.json` file for each instance as long as all of the fields are
populated, and the device identifier has been "approved".

Example `config.json` file:

Copy

    
    
    {
        "user": "service@company.com",
        "password": "RANDOM_LONG_PASSWORD",
        "server": "https://keepersecurity.com",
        "private_key": "yaeK4jMeIGNkSR2pi4xf2XGmYM094YMUoE8-QEW9CAA",
        "device_token": "g6RDMxr1t-bcVdBeBpz-xQ"
    }

As long as you have performed a device approval step at least one time, this
configuration file can be loaded on any number of servers.

If you plan to distribute this file to multiple instances, we recommend
protecting this file through secure storage facilities provided by your cloud
infrastructure. We also recommend assigning the user account to a Role
Enforcement policy on the Keeper Admin Console that is locked down based on IP
range.

##

Persistent Login Sessions

Persistent Login allows a Commander device to authenticate to Keeper without
having to populate the "password" in the configuration file. This is useful
for automation scripts or calling Commander from other software.

In order to enable this feature, you need to register the device and turn on
the persistent login setting. Once that's done the next time you login with
the specified configuration file, the session will be resumed and the user
will be automatically logged in. Several tokens are stored in the
`config.json` file in order to resume a session automatically.

###

Creating a Persistent Login Config

Commands to enable persistent login on a device for 30 days (max):

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> this-device register
    My Vault> this-device persistent-login on
    My Vault> this-device ip-auto-approve on
    My Vault> this-device timeout 30d
    My Vault> quit

You can use seconds as the value (e.g. 60 for 60 seconds) or numbers and
letters (e.g. 1m for one minute, 5h for 5 hours, and 7d for 7 days).

Also note that typing "logout" will invalidate the session. Just "quit" the
Commander session to exit.

Once persistent login is set up on a device, the `config.json` in the local
folder will look something like this:

Copy

    
    
    {
        "private_key": "8n0OqFi9o80xGh06bPzxTV1yLeKa5BdWc7f7CffZRQ",
        "device_token": "R2O5wkajo5UjVmbTmvWnwzf7DK1g_Yf-zZ3dWIbKPOng",
        "clone_code": "retObD9F0-WDABaUUGhP0Q",
        "user": "me@company.com",
        "server": "keepersecurity.com"
    }

You can create any number of persistent login sessions. However, the
persistent session option is not intended for dynamic multi-server
environments. If you share the exact configuration file on multiple servers,
persistent login will fail when attempting to login to the second server.

For multi-server dynamic environments, please refer to the prior section of
using a fully populated config file that is distributed to each instance.

###

Executing Commands with Persistent Login

If you would like to maintain different configurations, you can run Commander
with a specified config file. For example, this will open the CLI without
prompting for login:

Copy

    
    
    $ keeper --config=my_config.json shell

To leave the CLI, make sure to type "quit" instead of "logout". Typing
"logout" will expire the session and you'll need to create a new persistent
session config.

Another example would be executing a particular command without prompting for
login. In the below example, a new record is created automatically with a
single line.

Copy

    
    
    $ keeper --config=config_demo.json "add --login myuser -g --url https://google.com -t 'Google'"

##

Batch Mode through STDIN

You can batch execute a series of commands and pipe the file to STDIN of
Commander. For example, create a text file called `test.cmd` with the
following lines:

Copy

    
    
    add --login=user@gmail.com --pass=somemasterpass --url=https://google.com --force "Some Record Title"
    upload-attachment --file="/path/to/some/file.txt" "Some Record Title"
    share-record --email="user@company.com" --write "Some Record Title"

To run this file in a batch mode:

Copy

    
    
    cat test.cmd | keeper --batch-mode -

or

Copy

    
    
    keeper test.cmd

**Handling Errors**

The batch execution is aborted if some command returns failure. Use `@` in
front of the command to suppress the possible command error.

Copy

    
    
    add --login=user@gmail.com --pass=somemasterpass --url=https://google.com --force "Some Record Title"
    @upload-attachment --file="/path/to/some/file.txt" "Some Record Title"
    share-record --email="user@company.com" --write "Some Record Title"

**Batch Mode in Windows**

Following example shows how to execute three commands using Windows command
line:

Copy

    
    
    (echo ls -l && echo whoami && echo tree) | keeper --batch-mode -

###

Combining Batch Mode and Persistent Login

Copy

    
    
    $ keeper --config=my_config.json bunch_of_commands.cmd

##

Batch Mode from the CLI

Keeper supports a batch mode from within the CLI which can conveniently
execute commands sequentially.

The command is called "run-batch" and can be executed like below:

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> run-batch -d 10 "C:\My Drive\Keeper\commands.txt"

In this example, each command is executed with a delay of 10 seconds in
between.

On Linux environments, the path can also be specified such as:

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> run-batch -d 5 "/path/to/file.txt"

##

Store Configuration to Protected storage

The sensitive configuration file parameters (user, password, server,
device_token, private_key, clone_code) can be optionally stored in 3rd party
secrets managers or hardware security modules.

To use protected storage, add `config_storage` property to your config file.
`config_storage` value has URL format. Please reference the appropriate
section below for storage URL format.

Commander supports the following protected storages:

The configuration file can be modified to include auto-execution of commands
or other features. See the  for more details.

By setting up a persistent login configuration (as described in the ), you can
execute a series of batch commands without any prompt for login. For example:
