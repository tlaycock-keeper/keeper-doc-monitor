# Logging in

How to login and use the Keeper Commander CLI

###

First Login on a New Device

To login to Commander for the first time, click the Keeper Commander icon or
open a shell and type:

Copy

    
    
    keeper shell

####

Set Server

The Keeper Commander CLI will default to the US data center. To change
regions, use the `server` command:

**US** : `server US `**EU** : `server EU` **AU** : `server AU` **CA** :
`server CA` **JP** : `server JP` **GovCloud** : `server GOV`

Copy

    
    
    Use "server" command to change Keeper region > "server US"
    	US: keepersecurity.com
    	EU: keepersecurity.eu
    	AU: keepersecurity.com.au
    	CA: keepersecurity.ca
    	JP: keepersecurity.jp
    	GOV: govcloud.keepersecurity.us
    To login type: login <email>
    

Login to the shell by typing `login`. If this is your first login, you will
need to follow the device approval workflow. This is only needed once, as an
extra layer of security to trust the device you are on.

####

**First Login Example**

Copy

    
    
    Not logged in> login
    ...      User(Email): yourname@email.com
    Logging in to Keeper Commander
    
    Device Approval Required
    Approve by selecting a method below:
            "email_send" to send email
            "email_code=<code>" to validate verification code sent via email
            "keeper_push" to send Keeper Push notification
            "2fa_send" to send 2FA code
            "2fa_code=<code>" to validate a code provided by 2FA application
            "approval_check" check for device approval
    Type your selection: 
    

  * If you wish to approve via email:

    * Type `email_send` or __`es`

    * Enter the security code with `email_code=<code>`

  * If you wish to approve via Keeper Push:

    * Type `keeper_push`

    * Approve via push

    * Then type `approval_check`

  * If you wish to approve via 2fa code:

    * Input `2fa_send`

    * Then input `2fa_code=<code>`

Once complete you will receive the following message:

Copy

    
    
    Device was approved

###

Logging in**with a Master Password**

After device approval, you will immediately move to the login process, or if
you previously approved the device, this will be the first step.

####

**Master Password Login Example**

Copy

    
    
    Not logged in> login
    ...      User(Email): yourname@email.com
    Logging in to Keeper Commander
    Enter password for yourname@email.com
    Password: *********
    
    Successfully authenticated with Login V3 (Password)
    Syncing...
    Decrypted [23] record(s)
    My Vault>

###

Logging in With 2FA

If you have 2FA enforced on your account, you will be required to pass the 2FA
step before logging in with a Master Password. Your login flow in commander
will follow the same rules you have for logging into the Vault.

####

**Login Example with 2FA**

Copy

    
    
    Not logged in> login
    ...      User(Email): yourname@email.com
    Logging in to Keeper Commander
    This account requires 2FA Authentication
         U2F (FIDO Security Key)
         Send SMS Code
      3. TOTP (Google Authenticator) [ ENABLED ]
         DUO
    Selection:

Each 2FA method that is enabled will have a number next to it.

In this example, only TOTP is enabled, so `3` would need to be entered,
followed by the TOTP code. Enter the corresponding number to proceed:

Copy

    
    
    Selection: 3
    
    Enter 2FA Code or Duration: 2fa_duration=forever
    Enter 2FA Code or Duration: 123456

By default, Keeper Commander prompts for 2FA code on every login. To store 2FA
authentication for this device either for 30 days or forever, type one of the
following before entering the code:

  * `2fa_duration=30_days` to prompt for 2FA every 30 days, or...

  * `2fa_duration=forever` to never prompt again on this device

###

Logging in with a Proxy

If your network configuration requires using a proxy server you can use the
`proxy` command before logging in.

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> proxy -h                                                                                                                              
    usage: proxy [-h] [-a {list,add,remove}] [schema://[user:password@]host:port]
    
    Sets proxy server
    
    positional arguments:
      schema://[user:password@]host:port
                            "add": proxy address. Schemas are "socks5h", "http", "socks4", etc
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -a {list,add,remove}, --action {list,add,remove}
                            action

###

Enterprise SSO Login

If SSO is configured for your Keeper enterprise, the following screen will
appear for users that login to Commander:

Copy

    
    
    Not logged in> login
    ...      User(Email): yourname@email.com
    Logging in to Keeper Commander
    
    SSO Login URL:
    https://keepersecurity.com/api/rest/sso/saml/login/xxx
    
    Navigate to SSO Login URL with your browser and complete login.
    Copy a returned SSO Token into clipboard.
    Paste that token into Commander
    
      a. SSO User with a Master Password
      c. Copy SSO Login URL to clipboard
      o. Navigate to SSO Login URL with the default web browser
      p. Paste SSO Token from clipboard
      q. Quit SSO login attempt and return to Commander prompt
      
    Selection:

To login to Commander using SSO, you will need to paste a token provided by
the SSO provider from your web browser into Commander. To receive the SSO
token, follow these steps:

####

**SSO Login Using Default Browser**

To have Commander automatically open the default browser to the SSO Connect
page, enter "o" in the SSO selection and hit `Enter`

The default browser for your system will open to the SSO Connect page.

Depending on your operating system, settings, and administrator privileges,
Commander may be unable to open the web browser, in this case use the
following option to open the SSO Connect screen.

####

**SSO Login Using Pasted Token**

You can copy the URL to your SSO's logins screen from the SSO Connect text in
Commander, or enter "c" in the SSO selection and hit `Enter` to copy the URL
to your clipboard.

Copy

    
    
    SSO Login URL:
    https://keepersecurity.com/api/rest/sso/saml/login/xxx

Once the URL is copied, paste it into a web browser to navigate to the SSO
Connect page.

After a successful SSO login, the web page will show a yellow "Copy" button.
Click the button to copy the token.

####

Paste the SSO Token

Once the token has been copied, go back to Commander to complete the SSO
login.

In Commander enter **"p"** in the SSO selection screen and hit `Enter` to
paste the token from your clipboard into Commander and complete SSO login.

What if There is No "Copy login token" Button?

In some cases, the "Copy login token" button may not appear. This depends on
your SSO setup and Commander version. In this case, the SSO token will need to
be manually copied from the web page source.

The page will remain in a loading state (with spinning icon) to give you time
to find and copy the token. Though the spinning icon appears to be loading,
the page will not change.

Once you have opened the SSO Connect page in the browser, follow these
instructions to copy the SSO token:

Right click the web page and select "View Page Source"

With the page source open, search for "var token" and copy the token that
follows that text.

Be sure to copy all text between the quotation marks (") without copying the
quotation marks themselves. Note that the token is longer than the page shows.

There are two possible formats that the token could have for SSO login

**The token is a long quoted string**

****`var token = "aQwD`h&r`[...]"`

In this case copy everything within the quotation marks

####

**The token is a json object**

` var token = {'result':'success', 'password':"d8!xe3[...]"}`

in this case, copy the entire object including the curly brackets

Once the token has been copied, go back to Commander to complete the SSO
login.

In Commander enter "p" in the SSO selection screen and hit `Enter` to paste
the token from your clipboard into Commander and complete SSO login.

###

Device Approval with SSO Login

If device approval is turned on for your account, the device approval
selection will be shown after the first SSO login.

Copy

    
    
    Approve this device by selecting a method below:
      1. Keeper Push. Send a push notification to your device.
      2. Admin Approval. Request your admin to approve this device.
      r. Resume SSO login after device is approved.
      q. Quit SSO login attempt and return to Commander prompt.
    Selection: 

Enter your selection and hit `Enter` to continue with device approval.

1 : Approve with Keeper Push

2 : Approve with Admin Approval

r : Resume SSO login after the device has been approved

###

Use a Master Password with SSO Login

Customers who normally login to their Keeper Vault using Enterprise SSO Login
(SAML 2.0) can also login to Keeper Commander using a Master Password. To make
use of this capability, it must be enabled by the Keeper Administrator and
then configured by the user. The steps are below:

####

**Login to the Keeper Admin Console**

As the admin, login to the Keeper Admin Console as you normally do.

####

**Enable SSO Master Password Policy**

For the User/Role who will be accessing Keeper Commander, open the Role
Enforcement Policy setting screen. Enable the option "Allow users who login
with SSO to create a Master Password"

####

**Login to the End-User Vault using SSO**

As the user who will be using Commander, login to the Keeper Web Vault or
Keeper Desktop app with your SSO provider as you normally do.

####

**Create a Master Password**

Visit the Settings > General screen and setup a Master Password

After the Master Password is created, you are now able to login to Keeper
Commander.

####

Optional: Force SSO Master Password Login in Configuration File

Add the following line to your configuration file.

Copy

    
    
    { ...
        "sso_master_password": true,
    ...}

###

Persistent Login Sessions ("Stay Logged In")

Commander can be configured to stay logged in between sessions, and you can
also configure how long the device will remain logged in without activity.
This feature is referred to as persistent login or "Stay Logged In" in the
Vault UI.

Use the `this-device` command to set your preferences.

Example:

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> this-device
                         Device Name: Commander CLI on macOS
                    Data Key Present: missing
                     IP Auto Approve: OFF
                    Persistent Login: OFF
               Device Logout Timeout: 1 hour
           Enterprise Logout Timeout: 7 days
            Effective Logout Timeout: 1 hour
                         Is SSO User: True

To enable "Stay Logged In" so that you're not prompted for authentication, use
these commands:

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> this-device persistent-login on 
    My Vault> this-device register

If persistent login is enabled, you won't be prompted to authenticate the next
time you run Commander:

Copy

    
    
    user@mycomputer ~ % keeper shell
    Logging in to Keeper Commander
    Successfully authenticated with Persistent Login

Changing persistent-login ("stay logged in") affects all devices that you use
with Keeper

To set the inactivity logout timer to a certain number of minutes:

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> this-device timeout 600
    Successfully set "logout_timer" to 10 hours.
