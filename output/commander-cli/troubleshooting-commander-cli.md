  1. [Commander CLI](/en/keeperpam/commander-cli)

# Troubleshooting

In the event that our unquestionably perfect code fails to run here are some
things to try...

##

**UID Starts With '-'**

Record UIDs are randomly generated and sometimes begin with the '-' (hyphen)
character. When this happens, it prevents Commander CLI from recognizing the
UID as a UID value.

To use UIDs in a positional parameter that begin with '-' add '--' before the
UID.

**Example:**

Copy

    
    
    get -- -UREsVJNP7vU-KTyZ3YF9A

Commander CLI will then recognize the UID without confusing it for a command
switch. In this case, it will search for a record with the UID `-UREsVJNP7vU-
KTyZ3YF9A`

**Pairing UIDs that begin with '-' with additional command switches**

If you plan on pairing the UID with additional command switches, then the UID
needs to be placed after all the command switches. In other words, the UID
needs to placed as the last positional parameter.

**Example:**

Copy

    
    
    get --format json -- -UREsVJNP7vU-KTyZ3YF9A

**Using UID that begins with '-' as an argument**

If you need to use the UID as an argument for a command flag, there is instead
a different format.

To do this, add "=" after the flag, and wrap the UID in quotation marks.

**Example:**

Copy

    
    
    secrets-manager share add --app TestApp --secret="-fwZjKGbKnZCo1Fh8gsf5w"

##

Typed vs Untyped Records (V3 vs V2)

When using Commander you may encounter references to typed vs untyped or V2 vs
V3 records. There are a few fundamental differences between these records
which cause them to interact differently in some aspects of the platform.

What is a Typed Record (V3)

Records which have a record type are considered 'typed' or sometimes referred
to as 'V3'. These records have a malleable structure which can be defined and
customized as well as an updated encryption model with heightened security.

Typed records are required for some features, such as [Keeper Secrets
Manager](/en/keeperpam/secrets-manager/overview).

What is a Legacy Record (V2)

Older records which were created before the release of record types are called
'untyped', 'legacy' or 'V2' records. These records have a set structure with a
login, password, url, totp, and file attachment field (as well as notes). Any
other fields must be added as custom fields to the record.

###

How to Identify Typed vs Legacy Records

In Commander, when you view the details of a record with the `get` command,
Typed records will always show a type field, while Legacy records will have no
type field at all.

Copy

    
    
    Typed Record
    My Vault> get uxRrj[...]ZAM0bSQ
    
                     UID: uxRrj[...]ZAM0bSQ
                    Type: databaseCredentials
                   Title: LastPass Database
                   Notes: LP DB Notes
             type (text): SQL
                  (host): hostName | 3030
                 (login): SQL_Admin
         Database (text): MyDB
         
    Legacy Record
    My Vault> get 4XjSH[...]Gy1LAEg
    
                     UID: 4XjSH[...]Gy1LAEg
                   Title: My Record
                   Login: Login
                Password: Password

Additionally, the `ls -l` command shows records in a list with type as one
column. Any record with a value in that field is typed, and any record with no
value is legacy.

Copy

    
    
    My Vault> ls -l
        #  Record UID  Type                 Title                    Login                      URL
    ---  ------------- -------------------  -----------------------  -------------------------  -----------------------------------
      1  V[...]w       login                Typed                    MyLogin                    example.com
      2  q[...]A                            Legacy                   MyLegacyLogin              legacy.com

###

##

**Command Permissions**

You may encounter the following error message when attempting to perform an
action with Commander:

> You do not have the required privilege to perform this operation

The message indicates that the current logged in account does not have
permission to perform the requested action.

Many Commander commands require some form of permission policy to be enabled.
When relevant, the documentation should indicate when a permission is required
to use a command.

There are three main permission types that can lead to this message.:

###

Role Enforcement Policies

Keeper roles can specify permissions allowed for all users in that role. For
example a role can determine if users can share records or use Keeper Secrets
Manager. When a user has multiple roles, the most restrictive permissions
apply.

Read more about Role Enforcement Polices in the docs:

[![Logo](https://1748446847-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-
files/o/spaces%2F-LO5CAzpxoaEquZJBpYz%2Favatar.png?generation=1562027743273411&alt=media)Enforcement
PoliciesEnterprise Guide](https://docs.keeper.io/enterprise-
guide/roles/enforcement-policies)

###

Administrative Permissions

Keeper administrators have access to account-level actions and features which
can be turned off and on with these permission policies. These include things
like running compliance reports.

Read more about Administrative Permissions in the docs:

[![Logo](https://1748446847-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-
files/o/spaces%2F-LO5CAzpxoaEquZJBpYz%2Favatar.png?generation=1562027743273411&alt=media)Delegated
AdministrationEnterprise Guide](https://docs.keeper.io/enterprise-
guide/delegated-administration#delegated-admin-via-administrative-permissions)

###

**Secure Add-Ons**

Some features require an additional add-on to be used. These include features
such as Keeper Secrets Manager and the Advanced Reporting and Alerts Module
which is required to run custom reports. Secure add-ons can be managed in the
Secure Add-Ons section of the Keeper Admin Console.

Read more about managing add-ons in the docs:

Admin Console OverviewEnterprise Guide](https://docs.keeper.io/enterprise-
guide/getting-started-with-keeper-admin-console#additional-secure-add-ons)

##

**Installation Issues with Python**

Dependency issues are the most common problem, so please make sure you have an
updated version of Python 3 installed.

###

On **W** indows

Copy

    
    
    C:\>pip3 --version

Validate WinPython is correctly installed by checking the installed version
from launching the "WinPython Command Prompt" in the installation folder:

###

On Mac

MacOS ships with a default python installation that is too old and
unsupported. A current version of Python needs to be installed

Depending on your operating system security settings you may need to "Allow"
the application to run or install. To do this open "System Preferences" >
"Security and Privacy" > "General" tab

Validate Python is correctly installed by checking the installed version from
a terminal window:

Copy

    
    
    $ pip3 --version

Don't run the below, it'll report the older version of python:

Copy

    
    
    $  --version

##

**Working with MS-DOS / Windows Paths**

When using Commander in a Microsoft (Windows / DOS) environment, you may find
it expedient to use its native filesystem path formatting (with backslashes)
when referring to an external file in the context of a command call (e.g.,
when specifying a file in which to store the output of a command instead of
printing it to the screen).

Please note that, in such cases, it is recommended that the file-path be
wrapped in quotes (either single or double) in order for the command to be
parsed correctly by Commander.

For example, let's say you'd like to run the `list` command and output the
results (in CSV format) to _**C:\Users\user1\my_records.csv**_

The command in that case would be

Copy

    
    
    list --format csv --output 'C:\Users\user1\my_records.csv'

##

Security Audit Report Score Re-alignment Process

####

Context

Due to Keeper's zero-trust and zero-knowledge encryption model, enterprise-
level security audit reporting can sometimes result in vault-level security
scores that are inconsistent with the corresponding vault's own security audit
reporting. In most cases, correcting these mismatching scores can be done
simply by having each vault owner log in to their account via the Web Vault
app, without the need for any administrative action.

In the event that the above remedy does not result in re-aligned security
scores, however, a security data sync can be performed manually via the
following process:

####

The Process

As a Keeper administrator, log in to Commander and run the following:

Copy

    
    
    security-audit sync --hard <USER_EMAIL_1> <USER_EMAIL_2> ... <USER_EMAIL_N> 

where `<USER_EMAIL_1> ... <USER_EMAIL_N>` are the emails associated with the
vaults to be synced.

Alternatively, you can opt to initiate a sync for all vaults (instead of
targeting them individually as in the example above) using the following
command:

Copy

    
    
    security-audit sync --hard @all

To complete the process, have the owner of each affected vault log in to their
account using the latest version of Commander (installer available for
download [here](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/Commander/releases/latest)
under the "Assets" heading).

Please be aware that immediately following either of the command calls
described above, you may see inaccurate security audit scores for the
corresponding vaults.

This is temporary and will be corrected once each affected vault owner has
logged in to their account via the Commander app.

##

**SSL Certificate Errors**

When running Commander or related Keeper SDK code, if you receive SSL
certificate errors such as:****

**Certificate validation error. More info:**

**https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/commander-cli/using-
commander/troubleshooting-commander-cli#ssl-certificate-errors**

or

**requests.exceptions.SSLError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='keepersecurity.com',
port=443): Max retries exceeded with url:
/api/rest/authentication/get_device_token (Caused by
SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]
certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate
(_ssl.c:1108)')))**

If you receive this message, please make sure that your network is not
attempting to do packet inspection with a proxy. Due to our advanced
encryption, Keeper traffic cannot be intercepted by a network proxy device.
Consult with your IT team to allow traffic to keepersecurity.[com|eu|com.au]
on the firewall outbound.
